\subsection{Overview}
This chapter describes the basic methodology used to implement the flexibility options into the model. In particular, the components that extend the existing European electricity market model \textit{EDisOn} \cite{Dallinger2018} are described. These are sector coupling between the electricity market and hydrogen markets and the integration of \ac{EV}s. Furthermore, the second stage of the model framework that performs the redispatch calculations is described. Finally, the methodology required for the ex-post calculation of \ac{SEW} and its components is described. An overview of these model stages and components is given in Figure \ref{fig:two_stage_model}.
