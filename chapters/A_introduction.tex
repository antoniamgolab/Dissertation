\section{Background: Electrification of road transport sector in the context of the European system decarbonization}

European countries have committed to reducing 90\% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 2050. In 2023, the contribution to total European greenhouse gas emissions remained at 29\%, and the road transport sector accounted for around 73\% of the total transport-related emissions \cite{EEA2025GHGTransport}. To achieve such significant reductions over the next two and a half decades, zero-emission drivetrain technologies need to be rapidly adopted on a large scale. At the forefront of these technologies stands the battery-electric drive-train.

A transition towards electrification in the transport sector has long been established as the cost-optimal pathway for effectively reducing fossil fuel demand in the transport sector \cite{VANDERZWAAN2013562}. This is primarily driven by the energy efficiency of direct electrification, as well as the low cost of electricity provided through renewable energy sources \cite{Edelenbosch2017DecomposingTransport}. In particular, the battery-electric drivetrain has achieved significant technological and market maturity over the last decade, marked by substantial advances in charging speed, driving range, and continuously decreasing costs \cite{IEA2025GlobalEVOutlook}. A clear trend is emerging, as evidenced by the rapidly increasing market share of battery-electric vehicles in new registrations across all road transport segments. In 2023, battery electric vehicles accounted for nearly 15\% of all new car sales, while 40\% of newly bought buses were electric and 10\% of light and medium-haul commercial vehicles were battery-electric \cite{ICCT2024EUVehicleStats}. Yet this gradient in adoption has only begun to transform the existing fleet: as of 2023, just 1.8\% of the EU passenger car fleet, 0.1\% of trucks, and 2.5\% of buses were electric \cite{ACEA2025VehiclesEuropeanRoads}. This gap between zero-emission fleet numbers and total fleet composition underscores both the progress made and the scale of transformation still required.

This required transition towards electrified fleets is recognized and supported by European Union (EU) level policies. The EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy was published in 2020 \cite{EC2020SustainableMobility}. This document presents a comprehensive view of decarbonizing and modernizing all transport modes, along with generalized milestones for achieving a 90\% reduction in emissions. For road transport, it is specified that two important levers are essential. These include the uptake of zero-emission drive-train technologies, primarily battery-electric vehicles, and the shift of transport demand to lower-carbon modes, mainly rail. This was followed by the Fit for 55 Package in 2021 \cite{EC2021Fitfor55}. This policy package encompasses regulations that aim for a reduction of at least 55\% by 2030. To achieve this, regulations address CO\textsubscript{2} emission standards for road vehicles of different segments, regulations on the introduction of alternative fuels in the maritime and aviation and for charging and alternative fueling infrastructure. A significant regulation in this framework is the 100\% CO\textsubscript{2} emission reduction target for new passenger cars from 2035. A central element in this framework is the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR; Regulation (EU 2023/1804) \cite{EU2023AFIR}, which sets binding targets on expanding charging infrastructure for battery-electric vehicles, including passenger and heavy-duty vehicles, in terms of distance-based targets for the core European road Network, the Trans-European Transport network (TEN-T) \cite{EU2024TENT}, and compulsory national targets. The distance-based targets indicate the distances along the network at which charging or alternative fueling stations should be installed. On the national level, the regulation addresses the minimum availability of charging capacity, which is dependent on the number of registered battery-electric vehicles in each country. 


The build-up of charging infrastructure is vital to enable road transport electrification and, moreover, to support cost-effective transport and travel \cite{HOPKINS2023113398}. Demand-oriented siting of charger capacities has been identified as crucial to overcome range anxiety among BEV drivers and to provide convenient charging experiences \cite{RAINIERI202352}. In the commercial sector, well-located infrastructure also enables more time-efficient—and therefore more cost-efficient—charging operations. Furthermore, siting charging stations at locations of high utilization supports cost-effective infrastructure investments \cite{DU2024131374}. However, the quantification and geographic allocation of required charging capacities remain non-trivial problems. Capacity sizing must be balanced against infrastructure utilization, integration with the electricity system adds another layer of complexity, and limited empirical experience—owing to currently low adoption numbers—constrains model validation \cite{YE2024105908}.

%The road transport sector is a prominent contributor to Europe's\footnote{EU-27} greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 73\% of total transport sector emissions in 2023, and for 29\% of total European GHG emissions. There is a high urgency in reducing these emissions as the European Green Deal indicates a minimum requirement for a 90\% reduction in GHG emissions in the transport sector by 2050 [REF]. There are three levers that 
% Policies at the country level support electrification primarily by subsidizing the purchase of battery-electric vehicles, the installation of charging stations, and providing benefits such as free parking or toll exemptions [REF].

\section{Problem statement: Geographic allocation of future charging loads}
% \textit{maybe distinctly separate from the detailed operational research looking at singular fleets; or at a small geographic scope, f.e, a distribution grid}

The key challenge in determining charging demand for a defined geographic location is the \textit{mobility} of vehicles, which, unlike for other energy consumers such as buildings or industrial sites, geographically extends the options for allocating energy loads. This geographic flexibility is what makes the planning for energy supply infrastructure, including charging infrastructure, fundamentally different from other consumer sectors. 

This leads to the central problem statement addressed in this work, which is the spatial allocation problem of charging infrastructure that serves mobile consumers, i.e., vehicles embedded at a large geographic scope, i.e., beyond regions and countries. 
% This question of \textit{where} charging capacities are needed is composed of different layers: 

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Where is charging infrastructure \textit{needed}? 
%     \item How does the spatial configuration \textit{shape the demand and behavior}? 
%     \item How can the capacity be operated in an \textit{electricity-system-friendly} way?
% \end{itemize}


 This is practically urgent to two decision-making perspectives: First, transport policy makers and infrastructure planners who have to translate the regulations, such as the AFIR, into concrete investments in charging sites. These can include national, local authorities, or road network operators that are responsible for enabling, for example, by tendering or investing in local grid connection capacity, the build-up of the charging infrastructure. Second, operators of the transmission and electricity grid --- of, both the transmission and distribution system --- require long-term planning in the grid reinforcement to support increased peak loads through the charging of battery-electric vehicles and to integrate potential demand-side flexibilities for, for example, congestion management.

Therefore, this question of \textit{where} charging capacities are needed is composed of different layers: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{A}] Where is charging infrastructure \textit{needed}? 
    \item[\textbf{B}] How does the spatial configuration \textit{shape the demand and behavior}? 
    \item[\textbf{C}] How can the capacity be operated in an \textit{electricity-system-friendly} way?
\end{itemize}

In addressing this group and all related questions, the applied analytical tools require the representation of spatial mobility in charging demand to capture where vehicles travel. Origin-destination data, coupled with network topology, provides exactly this. 
The use of origin-destination flow representation allows for consideration of flexibility in demand allocation for large fleets. Origin-destination data indicate the number of passengers or specific freight goods transported between two regions. From this, the traffic flow by location can be deduced, while also capturing the geographic extent of the movement of accumulated fleets.

Despite an extensive body of work in the scientific literature dedicated to answering questions around optimal charging capacity planning, several dimensions remain unexplored. These literature gaps primarily refer to the feedback between the planned infrastructure and charging behavior across different vehicle segments. We address different literature gaps. Through the representation of our analysis using origin-destination data and traffic flow, we integrate the spatial extent of vehicle fleet movement which leads to novel insights on all three subquestions that are mentioned above (\textbf{A}, \textbf{B} and \textbf{C}). 
% The present work addresses questions of each of the layers \textbf{A}, \textbf{B} and \textbf{C}.

\begin{comment}
    
The overarching problem statement addressed by this work is the geographic allocation required for charging infrastructure capacities. Understanding long-term requirements for take-ups of battery-electric vehicles at \textit{large} geographic scopes, i.e., beyond regions and countries, is particularly crucial to two decision-making perspectives: First, transport policy makers and infrastructure planners who have to translate the regulations, such as the AFIR, to the concrete investments in charging sites. These can include national, local authorities, or road network operators that are responsible for enabling, for example, by tendering or investing in local grid connection capacity, the build-up of the charging infrastructure. Second, operators of the transmission and electricity grid --- of, both the transmission and distribution system --- require long-term planning in the grid reinforcement to support increased peak loads through the charging of battery-electric vehicles and to integrate potential demand-side flexibilities for, for example, congestion management.

Therefore, the question of \textit{where} charging capacities is grounded in the following questions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Where is the charging infrastructure \textit{needed}?
    \item How do the local charging capacity and the relative setup of the charging capacities impact \textit{charging behaviors and demands}? 
    \item How can charging capacities be utilized in an electricity-system-friendly way?  
\end{itemize}

Depending on the exact specification of the question surrounding the \textit{where}, different analytical methodologies are to be used. These mainly differ in the following modeling dimensions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Geographic scope}: With this definition, a geographic system boundary is drawn based on assuming the boundaries within which interactional effects in charging capacity planning may appear and the geographic extent within which vehicles would be moving
    \item \textbf{Spatial scale}: This translates to how specific the geographic allocation is required. For example, from the perspective of a highway network operator, the charging capacities by service area are of interest. In contrast to this, transmission grid operators provide electricity for large areas at each substation. Therefore, this problem requires less spatial granularity in the resolution.
    \item \textbf{Temporal scope}: The extent of the analysed period is essentially dictated by two core elements in the research question, which are the planning horizon of the charging infrastructure development, and, moreover, the scope of modeled developments in the system that impact the required charging infrastructure. This could, for example, include the development of the vehicle fleet for which the realistic modeling of the aging process required the temporal scope of 10+ years.
    \item \textbf{Temporal scale}: The granularity in time steps is similarly determined as the temporal scope. In the case of electricity system operation, the minimal temporal resolution is hourly, while assumptions on the average hourly distribution of charger utilization and mobility patterns allow for modeling at higher temporal granularity.
    \item \textbf{Vehicle segment}: Road transport vehicles can be coarsely divided into two groups: The \textit{passenger} and \textit{commercial} vehicles. For both passenger and commercial transport, the distinction between local/short-haul and long-distance/long-haul use is critical: the former can largely rely on home, workplace, or depot charging, while the latter depends on publicly accessible en-route infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

These model design choices are interdependent and are chosen in trade-off with each other. 



Why is it relevant? 
\begin{itemize}
    \item who is interested?
    \begin{itemize}
         \item electricity system planning perspective
    \item policy makers/planning in tender processes/ highway network infrastructure planners
    \end{itemize}
   
    \item understanding the following dimensions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item where charging infrastructure is needed
        \item how this impacts the demands (via which parameters? i.e. costs, non-monetary/subjective parameters)
        \item how the capacities can be utilized in a electricity-system-friendly way
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
These dimensions are driven by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item where: on different geographic levels (i.e. different geographic resolutions)  
    \item timing of the demand: long-term: when fleets are electrified; + short-term: when demand/flexibility is available (hour of the day)
    \item different by consumer segment characterized by different mobility patterns (temporal and locational extend)/ charging infrastructure utilization
\end{itemize}

Traffic flow \dots 
Compared to other consuming sectors, such as, f.e., building or industrial facilities, the transport sector has high flexiblity in the allocation of its demand in geographic dimension as multiple potential fueling/charging allocations are visited; because of different mobility patterns, dictating routing and timing of position.

A common representation at large geographic scopes for transport demand is origin-destination flows. These indicate how much passengers or specific freight goods are transported between two regions. Moreover, these also may indicate this by transport mode. Coupling origin-destination data with network topology results in information on specific traffic flow by location.



With the relevance and decade-long awareness concerning the challenges of charging infrastructure capacity allocation, there exists an extensive body of literature dedicated to analysing these different aspects. Along with, this state-of-the-art methodologies have been developed and used throughout. The traffic-flow-based representation of the demand has been leveraged in two ways (in the context of geographic allocation of charging capacity):
\begin{itemize}
    \item facility allocation problem adapted for charging capacity allocation
    \item national freight transport models 
\end{itemize}


This thesis advances the scientific literature on the geographic allocation of charging capacities across vehicle segments. The core contribution lies in grounding charging infrastructure planning in transport demand, using origin-destination data to represent where vehicles travel—and therefore where charging needs arise. This approach moves beyond state-of-the-art methodologies, which typically rely on static vehicle counts or uniform demand assumptions. The thesis further addresses three interrelated dimensions: consumer-segment-dependent fleet turnover, cost-optimal charging strategies, and the spatial modeling of charging infrastructure.
\end{comment}

%The vision of this thesis is to extend the scientific literature on geographic allocation of charging capacities for different vehicle segments to extend on understanding transport-demand-driven charging capacity allocation while leveraging the origin-destination data. 
%We thereby go beyond state-of-the-art methodologies to integrate this origin-destination-flow-based representation of charging demand, while addressing important interrelations around consumer-segment-dependent vehicle fleet turnover, the cost-optimal charging and the spatial modeling of charging capacities.

\section{Relevant literature in geographic charging load allocation}

What this chapter should answer based on problem statement:

\begin{itemize}
    \item what about small scale operational to large-scale operational bridge?
    \item What kind of questions surrounding the planning where answered using traffic flow? mainly geographic allocation questions 
    \item more comprehensive: other network based models? 
    \item but how is the spatial flexibility in demand represented here? 
    \item do these go also into the adoption of BEVs? 
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis' research questions}

    The thesis addressed four research questions that extend the state-of-the-art literature on geographic allocation of future charging capacity requirements. Each of the research questions is addressed within a scientific journal paper. Figure \ref{fig:overview} displays an overview of the articles characterized by the addressed problem statement, research question, and specifications on the corresponding publication. 

    Figure \ref{fig:contributions} illustrates the contextualization of paper in the state-of-the-art literature. The papers' insights extend the state of the art in various directions, reflecting on the diversity of BEV application segments that are characterized by different requirements for the charging infrastructure allocation. The first and second contribution addresses the private passenger car segment, while the third and fourth, focus on commercial vehicles fleets. Moreover, the focus of contributions one and three lie on the charging infrastructure planning for long-distance applications. Contributions two and four address the charging of vehicle used for shorter distances. The key difference here lies in the charging activity allocated en route.

This figure illustrates the relative allocation of the research questions and therefore the scope of this thesis.}
    \label{fig:contributions}
    \end{figure}
    \subsection{Research question 1 (RQ1)}
    The first contribution addresses the spatial allocation of fast-charging infrastructure for battery-electric passenger cars along highway networks. Long-distance travel by car depends on the availability of en-route charging, yet planning such infrastructure involves considerable uncertainty regarding future demand \cite{YE2024105908}. This demand is shaped by the technical characteristics of the electrified fleet (notably battery capacity and energy consumption), the share of battery-electric vehicles in the total fleet, and potential shifts in travel behaviour — including modal shift and overall demand reduction \cite{bmk}. The challenge lies in ensuring sufficient geographic coverage to enable long-distance electric mobility while avoiding overcapacity that results from overly optimistic or misaligned assumptions. We apply a traffic flow-based optimization approach to the Austrian highway network to quantify fast-charging capacity requirements under a range of decarbonization scenarios for 2030, addressing the following research question: 

    \textbf{Research question 1 (RQ1):} What are the required fast-charging capacities along Austria's highway network for battery-electric passenger cars under different decarbonization scenarios, and where are these allocated? 

    In particular, this paper contributes to the understanding of the impact of technological advances on battery performance parameters, i.e., the charging efficiency and the driving range, of the traveling fleet along the highway network on the cost-optimal geographic allocation of charging stations. To analyze this, a mixed-integer linear program is proposed that considers the flexible allocation of charging demand under the consideration of local magnitudes of traffic flow, the network topology and parameters of the battery and charging stations. Fast-charging capacities are determined at high geographic resolution for explicit service areas. Based on energy system decarbonization scenarios and sensitivity analysis, understanding of these parameters on the fast-charger requirements is gained.

    
    \subsection{Research question 2 (RQ2)}

    
    % The second contribution (REF contribution) focuses on charging infrastructure for the support of vehicles adoption throughout different consumer segments. We hereby focus on the role of public charging infrastructure in two aspects: the density of charging infrastructure stations within a region and the speed of charging infrastructure build up and its impact in the BEV adoption in neighbouring regions. 

    Public charging infrastructure plays a key role in enabling the adoption of passenger BEVs at a large scale. Early adopters of BEVs are characterized by high income and homeownership, adopters of lower income are dependent on affordable and accessible public charging infrastructure. Empirical case studies have found that there is a disparity in the availability for potential adopters of different income classes \citep{GAZMEH2024104222}. In the long term, BEV adoption must extend across all socio-economic backgrounds \citep{HOPKINS2023113398}. This broader adoption will shift reliance from home charging—currently central to BEV use—toward public charging infrastructure. Such a shift is particularly relevant given that lower-income households are more likely to travel longer distances to reach affordable charging facilities \cite{TATTINI2018265}.

    Along with this large-scale adoption, the flexibility in the geographic allocation of the charging activity increases through the increasing driving range \cite{SPAVEN2022133349}. Empirical studies have shown cross-border impacts of local public charging infrastructure to neighboring regions and countries, which is likely to increase with the spatial flexibility \cite{QIAN2024104400, SELENASHENG2022103256}. 

    Bringing these drivers of these aspects together in the context of public charging infrastructure expansion at the regional level, the research question is as follows: 
    
    \textbf{Research question 2:} To what extent do the speed and spatial distribution of public charging infrastructure expansion influence BEV adoption rates among various income groups and across neighboring regions? 

    We introduce here intangible costs of consumers that vary by income class levels to a techno-economic optimization to reflect on tolerances of time consumption on detouring to re-charge as well as tolerance for the time consumption of charging. Impacts across regions are analysed with the consideration of commuter traffic and the potential to flexibly allocate the charging activity between origin and destination charging. This contribution particularly highlights income-class-dependent preferences for charger utilization and quantifies the cross-border impact.

    \subsection{Research question 3 (RQ3)}

    In the third contribution, the focus lies on long-haul international trucking. The variable costs of fueling or charging are an essential driver of transportation costs. For fossil-fueled trucks, the country-dependent regulations of diesel taxation have determined allocations of the fueling activity \cite{bmk}. As there are country-dependent charging costs that are driven, by, next to taxation, local network fees and electricity-zone-dependent electricity prices \cite{Lanz2022, hildermeier2024power}, this phenomenon will shift, with the adoption of battery-electric trucks, also to allocation of charging loads. This can lead to high concentrations of charging load in high-unfavorable locations in the electricity system. This leads to the following research question:
    
    % The third contribution (REF to contribution) addresses the charging capacity planning for long-distance trucks. The article's focus lies on the cost-optimal decarbonization of long-distance road freight transport, considering charging infrastructure placement for international freight transport.  

    \textbf{Research question 3:} What magnitude of charging infrastructure capacities is affected by geographically varying network fees and electricity prices in the cost-optimal planning of charging infrastructure allocation for long-haul battery-electric trucks? 

    Addressing this question, we analyze the impact of geographically varying charging costs on the cost-optimal allocation and the route-dependent adoption of battery-electric trucks. International origin-destination truck flows are used as input for the cost optimization of fleet turnover, charging infrastructure development, and charging activities. In various electricity and technology pricing scenarios, we observe how local small charging costs along a corridor can lead to a high concentration of charging load, and, further, how local intervention in charging prices can prevent this. 

    \subsection{Research question 4 (RQ 4)}
    With the electrification of the commercial fleet, large peak charging power levels are expected. The large-scale requirements in shifting charging loads in time to minimize required investments into grid capacity and balancing energy have been demonstrated by many studies \cite{CROZIER2020114973}. For this, the spatio-temporal distribution of the future charging loads and flexibility potentials of different vehicle segments within an electricity market zone are required. The fourth contribution \cite{GOLAB2025134385} addresses the modeling of charging loads across multiple vehicle segments, ingtegrating both, regional and interregional travel, for the case of Austria in 2040: 
    
    % The fourth contribution (REF to contribution) extends to multiple transport segments of the electrified commercial fleet and aims to provide spatio-temporally varying charging patterns and flexibility potentials for the integration of the commercial BEV fleet to the electricity system. 

    \textbf{Research question 4 (RQ4):} What is the expected charging demand of the commercial BEV fleet spatio-temporally distributed in Austria in 2040?

    The methodology integrates both local and interregional transport patterns to estimate accumulated charging demands and flexibility potentials. The consideration of the interregional transport is hereby based on, again, traffic flow patterns that include national and transit transport going through Austria. This analysis showcases a bottom-up modeling of charging patterns implying the significant differences of charging flexibility by geographically varying transport demands by segments that are, moreover, dictated by transport flows along the highway network.
