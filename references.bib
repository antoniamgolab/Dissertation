ABSTRACT = {We analyze daily charging demand patterns of electric vehicles at DC fast charging stations along the German autobahn for an average week in 2020. For this we develop an agent based simulation tool based on current empirical mobility data. Our results show that already in 2020 about 1,000 charging processes per charging location and day might be realistic. In order to avoid long waiting times these charging locations should be equipped with about 20 charging points. A utilization rate of up to 80% makes a profitable operation of these stations highly probable. A sensitivity analysis indicates main parameters which influence the throughput of electric vehicles significantly.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the barriers facing the electric vehicle market is the incremental cost of the vehicles. However, many of the benefits of electric vehicles are not well understood and are omitted from cost-benefit analyses. These benefits relate to human health, air quality and the environment, economic growth, and grid resilience. VEIC conducted a study to identify the broad range of benefits that electric vehicles provide and, where sufficient data exists, developed estimates to quantify these benefits. Assessing the value of these benefits provides guidance for policy-makers to determine incentive and investment levels that accurately reflect the full value of electric vehicles to society.},

  abstract  = {Problems of poor network interoperability in electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, where data about real-time usage or consumption is not easily shared across service providers, has plagued the widespread analysis of energy used for transportation. In this article, we present a high-resolution dataset of real-time EV charging transactions resolved to the nearest second over a one-year period at a multi-site corporate campus. This includes 105 charging stations across 25 different facilities operated by a single firm in the U.S. Department of Energy Workplace Charging Challenge. The high-resolution data has 3,395 real-time transactions and 85 users with both paid and free sessions. The data has been expanded for re-use such as identifying charging behaviour and segmenting user groups by frequency of usage, stage of adoption, and employee type. Potential applications include but are not limited to simulating and parameterizing energy demand models; investigating flexible charge scheduling and optimal power flow problems; characterizing transportation emissions and electric mobility patterns at high temporal resolution; and evaluating characteristics of early adopters and lead user innovation.}

abstract="Environmental taxes and oil market fluctuations can increase road fuel prices significantly and are likely to play a big role in the future. This raises social justice issues, as some low-income households rely on cars for access to services and opportunities but struggle to afford related expenses. The impacts of fuel price increases are unevenly spatially distributed, as shown by transport, planning and urban research. We investigate spatial patterns of vulnerability to fuel price increases in Italy, a country where the problem is particularly pronounced due to high motorisation rate relative to income, and high fuel prices. We define vulnerability as the combination of high exposure (high car use), high sensitivity (low income) and low adaptive capacity (high car dependence). Based on municipality-level data on motorisation and the journey to work from the 2011 Italian Census and official income tax revenue data for 2012 (as a proxy for income) we derive a composite indicator of vulnerability. The results show: i) a co-location of low-income and high car use on the periphery of many Italian city regions; ii) stark interregional differences, with lower income levels in the South driving high levels of vulnerability, despite lower levels of car ownership and use.",

abstract = {This article investigates possible evolution pathways for the transport sector during the 21st century, globally and in Europe, under a climate change control scenario. We attempt to shed light on the question how the transport sector should best be decarbonized. We perform our study with the global bottom-up energy systems model TIAM-ECN, a version of the TIAM model that is broadly used for the purpose of developing energy technology and climate policy scenarios, which we adapted for analyzing in particular the transport sector. Given the global aggregated perspective of TIAM-ECN, that in its current version yields at every point in time a single CO2 price for different forms of energy use across geographic regions and economic sectors, it generates a decarbonization process that for the transport sector occurs later in time than for the power sector. This merely reflects that emission reductions are generally cheaper for electricity production than for transportation, and that it is thus cost-minimizing to spend limited financial resources available for CO2 emissions abatement in the power sector first. In our scenarios the use of hydrogen in internal combustion engines and fuel cells, rather than electricity as energy carrier and batteries to store it, gradually becomes the dominant transport technology. This outcome is in agreement with some recent publications but is at loggerheads with the current popularity of the electric car. Based on sensitivity analysis we conclude that even if the establishment of a hydrogen infrastructure proves about an order of magnitude more costly than modeled in our base case, electricity based transportation only broadly emerges if simultaneously also the costs of electric cars go down by at least 40% with respect to our reference costs. One of the explanations for why the electric car is today, by e.g. entrepreneurs, often considered the supposed winner amongst multiple future transportation options is that the decision horizon of many analysts is no more than a few decades, instead of a full century. Electric cars fit better the current infrastructure than hydrogen fueled vehicles, so that from a short time perspective (covering the next decade or two) investments are not optimally spent by establishing an extensive hydrogen distribution network. Hence the path-dependency created by the present existence of a vast power transmission and distribution network can make electricity the most efficient choice for transportation, but only if the time frame considered is short. Electric transportation generally proves the more expensive alternative in our long-term perspective, except when electric car costs are assumed to drop substantially.}

  abstract  = {Various regulatory and fiscal policy instruments are in force to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases and local pollutants emitted by private cars. The incentives operate primarily-or exclusively-on the newest generation of cars. But how fast will technological developments affecting new vehicle models penetrate into the car fleet? The speed at which the adverse effects of private car use will be mitigated through the normal vehicle renewal process, or through an accelerated one, carries considerable interest. Suitable modelling tools are needed. This paper aims to demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of a bottom-up stock-flow modelling approach to private car

abstract="This work shows a review about the multimodal transport network problem. This kind of problem has been studied for several researchers who look for solutions to the large numbers of problems relating on the transport systems like: traffic jam, pollution, delays, among others. In this work are presented a standard mathematical formulation for this problem and some other variations, which make the problem more complex and harder to be solved. There are many approaches to solve it that are found in the literature and they are divided according to classical methods and soft computing methodologies, which combine approximate reasoning as fuzzy logic and functional as metaheuristics and neural networks. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages that are also shown. A novel approach to solve the multimodal transport network problem in fuzzy environment is developed and this approach is also applied in a theoretical problem to illustrate its effectiveness.",

ABSTRACT = {Distance is one of the important factors in determining transportation cost and travel time, and it can be easily estimated by measuring the circuity of road networks. This study calculated the circuity factors to estimate the network distance for 27 forest roads (about 105 km) in South Korea. For this purpose, ridge, mid-slope, and valley roads were classified according to the construction location of the mountain slope, and the weighted and unweighted circuity factor (each 500-m section) were calculated. The average value of weighted circuity was 1.55: mid-slope roads (2.09), ridge roads (1.36), and valley roads (1.09). The average unweighted circuity factors were 1.61 for mid-slope roads, 1.21 for ridge roads, and 1.07 for valley roads. This study found that the circuity of the forest road network was most affected by the mountain terrain. In addition, the circuity factor increased with increasing network distance in the mid-slope roads but was not affected by the network distance in ridges and valleys. To improve the efficiency of transportation in the forest road network, it is important to locate the ladings and properly connect with the public road network.},

  abstract  = {With rapidly decreasing purchase prices of electric vehicles, charging costs are becoming ever more important for the diffusion of electric vehicles as required to decarbonize transport. However, the costs of charging electric vehicles in Europe are largely unknown. Here we develop a systematic classification of charging options, gather extensive market data on equipment cost, and employ a levelized cost approach to model charging costs in 30 European countries (European Union 27, Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland) and for 13 different charging options for private passenger transport. The findings demonstrate a large variance of charging costs across countries and charging options, suggesting different policy options to reduce charging costs. A specific analysis on the impacts and relevance of publicly accessible charging station utilization is performed. The results reveal charging costs at these stations to be competitive with fuel costs at typical utilization rates exhibited already today.}
