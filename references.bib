@article{Napoli2020,
abstract = {Gradual electrification is widely considered as a feasible strategy for reducing the oil dependency and CO2 emissions of road transportation. In chase of these aims increasing importance has been attributed to Electric Vehicles (EVs). Although the European Commission has strongly supported sustainable mobility initiatives in recent years, with the purpose of decarbonizing road transport and mitigating urban air pollution, results are below expectations. Among the initiatives that can be implemented the most important is certainly the use of electric vehicles on a large scale but it will be necessary, in parallel, to plan an appropriate system of infrastructures that will be able to support the expansion. In this paper a methodology to provide optimal locations of electric vehicle infrastructures in a highway network is proposed. The procedure can also be used to support the implementation of the DAFI (Directive on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure). The goal is to estimate the basic number of charging stations and determine their correct allocation on the road network by analyzing the supply and demand and considering the psychological component of the driver. In Part 1, the subject of this research article, a model is presented to detect how many charging infrastructures are required within the service areas and to identify their location. After the description of the solution algorithm, a test application is performed in order to assess model and technique. With the aim of analysing a high-level system, the model will be used, in Part 2 of the work, to calculate and distribute the charging point on the Italian case study.},

abstract = {This paper applies an energy systems model to evaluate how shared mobility (ride-hailing and shared autonomous vehicles), public buses, alternative energy sources (electricity and biofuels) and carbon pricing contribute to reduce passenger vehicles CO2 emissions in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, from 2016 to 2050. Public buses and carpooled shared mobility increase system capacity, resulting in lower vehicle ownership, energy demand and CO2 emissions, as well as savings per ton of CO2 abated (from $3 to $4186). Biofuels reduce CO2 emissions at no increased system cost, while carbon pricing is the most effective policy to reduce CO2 emissions, but it is costlier than the alternatives and results in greater private vehicle use (up to 260%) if the expansion of zero-carbon public transportation remains limited due to technology adoption. The policy that reduces the most emissions (by 84%) combines the expansion of renewable electricity generation and implementation of a CO2 price.},

abstract = {This paper proposes different policy scenarios to cut CO2 emissions caused by the urban mobility of passengers. More precisely, we compare the effects of the 'direct tool' of carbon tax, to a combination of 'indirect tools' - not originally aimed at reducing CO2 (i.e. congestion charging, parking charges and a reduction in public transport travel time) in terms of CO2 impacts through a change in the modal split. In our model, modal choices depend on individual characteristics, trip features (including the effects of policy tools), and land use at origin and destination zones. Personal "CO2 emissions budgets" resulting from the trips observed in the metropolitan area of Lille (France) in 2006 are calculated and compared to the situation related to the different policy scenarios. We find that an increase of 50% in parking charges combined with a cordon toll of €1.20 and a 10% travel time decrease in public transport services (made after recycling toll-revenues) is the winning scenario. The combined effects of all the policy scenarios are superior to their separate effects.},

abstract = {The European Green Deal has been heralded as the“Europe's man on the moon moment” as it aims to achieve 100\% GHG reductions by 2050. Achieving the decarbonization of the energy system will be driven by a combination of factors and synergies between technological development, policy exertion and societal attitudes. In this paper, we present an original set of future storylines until the year 2050 to inspire modelers, policy makers, industry actors, and the public to understand: Without technological developments in the next decades, to what extent can we rely on societal commitment or stronger cooperation within the EU to achieve climate targets? What technological innovations could become a cornerstone of an effective European energy transition? Through analyzing four pathways (shaped by the crossroads of policy-technology-society developments), results indicate that high electrification rates are imminent to achieve a rapid decarbonization. This implies that technology development and deployment must go hand-in-hand with strong policy enforcement in the short-term to speed-up the energy transition. Then, based on a review of European energy transition scenarios, these and other insights are compared vis-à-vis with other scenarios studies to identify similarities of pathway results and to elaborate on consolidated findings relevant to the EU Green Deal.}

@article{Dong2018,
abstract = {With the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs), the EV fast charging load will significantly affect the voltage quality of electricity distribution networks. On the other hand, EVs have potentials to change the choices of charging locations due to the incentives from the variations of charging prices, which can be considered as a flexible response resource for electricity distribution networks. In this paper, a charging pricing strategy of EV fast charging stations (FCSs) was developed to determine the pricing scheme for the voltage control of electricity distribution networks, which consisted of a simulation model of EV mobility and a double-layer optimization model. Considering the travel characteristics of users, the simulation model of EV mobility was developed to accurately determine the fast charging demand. Taking the total income of FCSs and the users' response to the pricing scheme into account, the double-layer optimization model was developed to optimize the charging pricing scheme and minimize the total voltage magnitude deviation of distribution networks. A test case was used to verify the proposed strategy. The results show that the spatial distribution of EV fast charging loads was reallocated by the proposed charging pricing scheme. It can also be seen that the proposed strategy can make full use of the response capacity from EVs to improve the voltage profiles without decreasing the income of the FCSs.},

@article{Chen2016,
abstract = {To solve the problem, because of which conventional quick-charging strategies (CQCS) cannot meet the requirements of quick-charging for multiple types of electric vehicles (EV) on highways where vehicle inflow is excessive, this paper proposed a new quick-charging strategy (NQCS) for EVs: on the premise of not affecting those EVs being charged, the remaining power of the quick-charging pile with multiple power output interfaces is used to provide a synchronous charging service for EVs waiting in the queue. To verify the effectiveness of this strategy, a power distribution model of charging pile and a queuing model of charging station (CS) were constructed. In addition, based on an actual highway service area where vehicle inflow is excessive during the simulation period (0:00-24:00), charging situations of CQCS and NQCS were respectively simulated in a charging station (CS), with different number of chargers, by basic queuing algorithm and an improved queuing algorithm. The simulation results showed that when the relative EV inflow is excessive, compared to CQCS, NQCS not only can reduce user waiting time, charging time, and stay time, but also can improve the utilisation rate of charging infrastructure and service capacity of CS and reduce the queue length of CS. At the same time, NQCS can reduce the impact on the power grid. In addition, in NQCS, the on-demand power distribution method is more efficient than the average power distribution method. Therefore, NQCS is more suitable for quick-charging for multiple types of EVs on highways where vehicle inflow is excessive.},

@article{Gusrialdi2017,
abstract = {The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on highways calls for the installment of adequate charging infrastructure. Since charging infrastructure has limited capacity, EVs need to wait at a charging station to get charged, and their waiting times may differ significantly from one location to another. This paper aims at developing a strategy to coordinate the queues among the charging stations, with only local information about traffic flows and the status of EV charging stations along a bidirectional highway, so that excessively long waiting times can be avoided. Specifically, a distributed algorithm is presented to schedule EV flows into neighboring charging stations, so that EVs are all appropriately served along the highway and that all the charging resources are uniformly utilized. In addition, a distributed decision making policy is developed to influence the aggregate number of EVs entering any given service station, so that each EV makes an appropriate decision (i.e., whether or not it should enter the next charging station) by contributing positively to meeting the desired queue length at service stations and by considering its own battery constraint. Performance improvement of the proposed strategy is illustrated via one of the highways in the United States, namely the Florida Turnpike.},

abstract = {Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) offer the potential to reduce both oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions, but have a limited utility due to factors including driver range anxiety and access to charging infrastructure. In this paper we apply NREL's Battery Lifetime Analysis and Simulation Tool for Vehicles (BLAST-V) to examine the sensitivity of BEV utility to range anxiety and different charging infrastructure scenarios, including variable time schedules, power levels, and locations (home, work, and public installations). We find that the effects of range anxiety can be significant, but are reduced with access to additional charging infrastructure. We also find that (1) increasing home charging power above that provided by a common 15 A, 120 V circuit offers little added utility, (2) workplace charging offers significant utility benefits to select high mileage commuters, and (3) broadly available public charging can bring many lower mileage drivers to near-100% utility while strongly increasing the achieved miles of high mileage drivers.}

abstract = {The public as well as the private sector that includes automakers and charging network companies are increasingly investing in building charging infrastructure to encourage the adoption and use of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) as well as to ensure that current facilities are not congested. However, building infrastructure is costly and, like road congestion, when there is significant uptake of PEVs we may not be able to “build out of congestion.” Modelling the choice of charging infrastructure of more than 3000 PEV drivers who had the opportunity to select among home, work, and public locations, we focus on understanding the importance of factors driving demand such as: the cost of charging, driver characteristics, access to charging infrastructure, and vehicle characteristics. We find that differences in the cost of charging play an important role in the demand for charging location. PEV drivers tend to substitute toward workplace charging when they pay a higher electricity rate at home, more so when the former is free. Additionally, socio-demographic factors like dwelling type and gender, as well as vehicle technology like electric range, influence the choice of charging location.},

@article{Engel2018,
abstract = {Access to efficient charging could become a roadblock to electric-vehicle uptake. Let's look at the numbers and costs behind the problem. Ask any electric-vehicle (EV) shopper: poor range and limited attractiveness have long been the two biggest bottlenecks to EV uptake. Now, however, with more than 350 new, feature-laden EV models to debut by 2025, with ranges that increasingly top 200 miles, these attributes pose less of a hurdle. Instead, if consumers purchase EVs at the expected rates in the next five to ten years, a lack of charging infrastructure could become an obstacle to EV adoption. Recognizing the charging-capacity gap Consumers rank not having enough access to efficient charging stations as the third most serious barrier to EV purchase, behind price and driving range. That's according to McKinsey's 2016 EV consumer survey of buyers considering battery-powered EV in China, Germany, and the United States. With EV prices declining and ranges expanding, charging could soon become the top barrier. McKinsey's base-case scenario for EV adoption suggests approximately 120 million EVs could be on the road by 2030 in China, the European Union, and the United States (Exhibit 1). The aggressive-case scenario could see that double. Along with different levels of EV adoption across regions, structural considerations will make charging-station demand highly localized. For example, compare a city like Los Angeles, with many single-family low-rise homes that have parking garages, with Manhattan, where high-rise multi-unit apartment dwellings prevail. These two cities will have extremely different EV charging-infrastructure needs.},

Our study aims at estimating the extent to which an increasing availability of public charging infrastructure promotes consumers decisions to switch to EVs. We make use of a German data set including monthly registrations of new cars at the ZIP-code level between 2012 and 2017 and match it with the official registry of charging stations. We measure charging infrastructure by its quantity, capacity and abundance in order to estimate its impact on EV adoption. A dynamic heterogeneous panel approach is deployed in order to identify the structural long-run relationship between charging infrastructure and monthly EV registrations. We find evidence of a positive long-run relationship (and also of a causal link) but on a rather low scale. We conclude that consumers do not necessarily react to the mere number of public chargers but attach more importance to charging speed and are to a large extent influenced by unobservable common factors.},

@article{Ajanovic2015,
abstract = {In recent years, about a century after reaching their first prime in the early 1900s, electric vehicles (EVs) have received growing attention again. Politicians in various countries have recognized EVs as a promising technological alternative to fossil fuel driven cars in combating global warming. However, for a broader market penetration considerable barriers have to be removed. The most important are high investment costs and low driving ranges, both caused by the major weakness of EVs-their battery. The core objective of this article is to investigate the future market prospects of various types of EVs, with the economics of EVs in comparison to conventional cars playing a key role. Only if the final driving costs can be considerably reduced will EVs gain significant market shares. In addition to this also the environmental aspects are very important because they are a major motivation in supporting and promotion of EVs. However, the policies and measures implemented vary between countries, meaning there is huge potential for an exchange of lessons learned. The major conclusion of this article is that future prospects of EVs are only bright if the costs of batteries can be brought down through technological learning and if improved storage can lead to higher driving ranges. However, to harvest the full environmental benefits of EVs the electricity for EVs must be generated from renewable energy sources. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley},

@article{Franke2013,
abstract = {We examined the psychological dynamics underlying charging behaviour of electric vehicle (EV) users. Data from 79 EV users were assessed in a 6-month EV field study. On average, users charged their EV three times per week, drove 38 km per day, and they typically had a large surplus of energy remaining upon recharging. Based on first findings concerning charging style among mobile phone users, we hypothesized that user-battery interaction style (UBIS) is a relevant variable for understanding charging behaviour of EV users. We developed measures to assess UBIS. Results show that it is a relatively temporally stable characteristic which also shows some cross-device consistency. As predicted by our conceptual model, UBIS and comfortable range explain the charge level at which people typically recharged. UBIS was related to users' confidence in their mental model of range dynamics, the utilization of range, and to excess energy from renewable sources. This research has implications for optimizing sustainability of electric mobility systems.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Transportation electrification is one of the main research areas for the past decade. Electric vehicles (EVs) are taking over the market share of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The increasing popularity of EVs results in higher number of charging stations, which have significant effects on the electricity grid. Different charging strat2egies, as well as grid integration methods, are being developed to minimize the adverse effects of EV charging and to strengthen the benefits of EV grid integration. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the current situation of the EV market, standards, charging infrastructure, and the impact of EV charging on the grid is presented. The paper introduces the current EV status, and provides a comprehensive review on important international EV charging and grid interconnection standards. Different infrastructure configurations in terms of control and communication architectures for EV charging are studied and evaluated. The electric power market is studied by considering the participation roles of EV aggregators and individual EV owners, and different optimization and game based algorithms for EV grid integration management are reviewed. The paper specially presents an evaluation on how the future EV development, such as connected vehicles, autonomous driving, and shared mobility, would affect EV grid integration as well as the development of the power grid moves toward future energy Internet and how EVs would affect and benefit the development of the future energy Internet. Finally, the challenges and suggestions for the future development of the EV charging and grid integration infrastructure are evaluated and summarized.},

abstract = {The world population depends highly on fossil fuels, particularly for transportation and power generation. This dependency leads to oil price increases because of the depletion of fossil fuels. Burning of fossil fuels also increases greenhouse gas emissions that are greatly responsible for global warming. Thus, electric vehicles (EVs) are considered one of the premium solutions in the land transportation system because they can significantly reduce the dependency on crude oil and minimize transportation-related carbon dioxide emissions along with other pollutants. This study presents an extensive review of the three key areas of EV research, namely, EV charging technologies, the various impacts of EVs, and optimal EV charging station (CS) placement and sizing. Several technical publications related to EV charging technologies are highlighted, and the performance comparison of different EV technologies is discussed. A review of literature on these key areas reveals an increasing interest in these topics in the last decade, with the impacts of EV on the electric power system and the optimal placement and sizing of CS issues widely investigated. By providing an overview of these areas, this study demonstrates the current issues and challenges of widespread deployment of EVs in the market as well as the future research direction in this field. A total of 185 publications are arranged and appended for quick referencing.}

abstract = {One of the barriers holding back the large-scale development of electric vehicles is underdeveloped charging infrastructure. The optimal location of charging stations has received much attention, whereas the development of charging infrastructure over time and its economic implications remain a less explored topic, especially in the context of dynamic inductive charging. This work compares the infrastructure costs for two electric vehicle charging solutions deployed on highways: fast-charging stations and a dynamic charging lane based on wireless inductive charging technology. The deployment costs are estimated using a simplified infrastructure model for a highway corridor. The model first defines the required charging capacity based on projected future demand, sizes the charging infrastructure, and then determines the related costs, revenues, and net present value. A numerical example based on the French highway context is also presented. The results show that the payback period is much longer for dynamic charging lanes that for charging stations. In addition, the charging lane infrastructure cannot be installed gradually over time but requires a major investment from the start while bringing in little revenue early on.},

@article{Ghamami2016,
abstract = {This paper proposes to optimally configure plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging infrastructure for supporting long-distance intercity travel using a general corridor model that aims to minimize a total system cost inclusive of infrastructure investment, battery cost and user cost. Compared to the previous work, the proposed model not only allows realistic patterns of origin-destination demands, but also considers flow-dependent charging delay induced by congestion at charging stations. With these extensions, the model is better suited to performing a sketchy design of charging infrastructure along highway corridors. The proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer program with nonlinear constraints and solved by a specialized metaheuristic algorithm based on Simulated Annealing. Our numerical experiments show that the metaheuristic produces satisfactory solutions in comparison with benchmark solutions obtained by a mainstream commercial solver, but is more computationally tractable for larger problems. Noteworthy findings from numerical results are: (1) ignoring queuing delay inducted by charging congestion could lead to suboptimal configuration of charging infrastructure, and its effect is expected to be more significant when the market share of PEVs rises; (2) in the absence of the battery cost, it is important to consider the trade-off between the costs of charging delay and the infrastructure; and (3) building long-range PEVs with the current generation of battery technology may not be cost effective from the societal point of view.},

@article{Pagany2019,
abstract = {With view to the high share of the transport sector in total energy consumption, e-mobility should play an important role within the transition of the energy systems. Policymakers in several countries consider electric vehicles (EV) as an alternative to fossil-fueled vehicles. In order to allow for the development of EV, the charging infrastructure has to be set up at locations with high charging potential, identified by means of various criteria such as demand density or trip length. Many methodologies for locating charging stations (CS) have been developed in the last few years. First, this paper presents a broad overview of publications in the domain of CS localization. A classification scheme is proposed regarding modeling theory and empirical application; further on, models are analyzed, distinguishing between users, route or destination centricity of the approaches and outcomes. In a second step, studies in the field of explicit spatial location planning are reviewed in more detail, that is, in terms of their target criteria and the specialization of underlying analytical processes. One divergence of these approaches lies in the varying level of spatial planning, which could be crucial depending on the planning requirements. It is striking that almost all CS locating concepts are proposed for urban areas. Other constraints, such as the lack of extensive empirical EV traffic data for a better understanding of the driving behavior, are identified. This paper provides an overview of the CS models, a classification approach especially considering the problem's spatial dimension, and derives perspectives for further research.},

@article{Niels2019,
abstract = {This paper focuses on the planning of a suitable public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs), especially in rural areas. A model-based optimization approach is presented that takes four different user groups of public charging infrastructure into account: inhabitants, commuters, hotel guests, and short-term visitors of tourist destinations and central locations. The methodology consists of three steps: In a first step, the dimension of charging demand at public charging stations, i.e. The number of charging events per day, is forecast on a macroscopic level for every municipality and for each of the four user groups. Afterwards, the forecast charging demand is located within the municipality for each customer group, i.e. destinations of the respective customer groups are identified. In a third step, we optimally allocate charging stations according to the dimension and spatial distribution of the forecast demand. We analyze three different scenarios with a growing share of EVs and a growing average range, which represent different stages of the development of electric mobility. The method is applied to a region in the south-east of Germany consisting of 50 municipalities, and results are presented.},

@article{Napoli2020,
abstract = {Gradual electrification is widely considered as a feasible strategy for reducing the oil dependency and CO2 emissions of road transportation. In chase of these aims increasing importance has been attributed to Electric Vehicles (EVs). Although the European Commission has strongly supported sustainable mobility initiatives in recent years, with the purpose of decarbonizing road transport and mitigating urban air pollution, results are below expectations. Among the initiatives that can be implemented the most important is certainly the use of electric vehicles on a large scale but it will be necessary, in parallel, to plan an appropriate system of infrastructures that will be able to support the expansion. In this paper a methodology to provide optimal locations of electric vehicle infrastructures in a highway network is proposed. The procedure can also be used to support the implementation of the DAFI (Directive on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure). The goal is to estimate the basic number of charging stations and determine their correct allocation on the road network by analyzing the supply and demand and considering the psychological component of the driver. In Part 1, the subject of this research article, a model is presented to detect how many charging infrastructures are required within the service areas and to identify their location. After the description of the solution algorithm, a test application is performed in order to assess model and technique. With the aim of analysing a high-level system, the model will be used, in Part 2 of the work, to calculate and distribute the charging point on the Italian case study.},

abstract = {This paper presents a literature review of studies that investigate infrastructure needs to support the market introduction of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). It focuses on literature relating to consumer preferences for charging infrastructure, and how consumers interact with and use this infrastructure. This includes studies that use questionnaire surveys, interviews, modelling, GPS data from vehicles, and data from electric vehicle charging equipment. These studies indicate that the most important location for PEV charging is at home, followed by work, and then public locations. Studies have found that more effort is needed to ensure consumers have easy access to PEV charging and that charging at home, work, or public locations should not be free of cost. Research indicates that PEV charging will not impact electricity grids on the short term, however charging may need to be managed when the vehicles are deployed in greater numbers. In some areas of study the literature is not sufficiently mature to draw any conclusions from. More research is especially needed to determine how much infrastructure is needed to support the roll out of PEVs. This paper ends with policy implications and suggests avenues of future research.},

@article{Ajanovic2020,
abstract = {Currently, the electrification of passenger cars is seen as one of the key strategies for heading toward a sustainable transport system. Of special interest are battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which can enable significant emission reductions if electricity used is produced from renewable energy sources. However, mainly due to their high investment costs (retail purchase price) of BEVs, they are currently not economically competitive with conventional fossil-fueled vehicles without different supporting policy measures. This paper analyzes current costs and future prospects for BEVs compared to conventional petrol cars looking at the total costs of ownership. Furthermore, the future prospects are investigated considering technological learning for BEVs, CO2 taxes for fuels, and various other policy framework conditions such as rebates for the purchase of the BEVs. The major conclusions are as follows: (i) to improve the economics of BEVs, a very important aspect is the introduction of CO2-based fuel taxes; (ii) regarding economics, the second important aspect is the reduction of the investment costs of the BEVs due to technological learning, especially of the battery; (iii) in addition, the introduction of CO2-based registration taxes for the purchase of passenger cars makes sense; (iv) subsidies or rebates for the purchase of a BEV maybe a measure successful in the short term and helpful to stimulate technological learning; (v) by far, the highest uncertainty regarding the future prospects of BEVs is how fast technological learning will take place, especially for the battery, and how the future development of batteries will be. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

abstract = {Energy demand of a transport sector has constantly been increasing in the recent years, consuming one third of the total final energy demand in the European Union (EU) over the last decade. A transition of this sector towards sustainable one is facing many challenges in terms of suitable technology and energy resources. Especially challenging transition is envisaged for heavy-weight, long-range vehicles and airplanes. A detailed literature review was carried out in order to detect the current state of the research on clean transport sector, as well as to point out the gaps in the research. In order to calculate the resources needed for the transition towards completely renewable transport sector, four main alternatives to the current fossil fuel systems were assessed and their potential was quantified, i.e. biofuels, hydrogen, synthetic fuels (electrofuels) and electricity. Results showed that electric modes of transport have the largest benefits and should be the main aim of the transport transition. It was calculated that 72.3\% of the transport energy demand on the EU level could be directly electrified by the technology existing today. For the remaining part of the transport sector a significant demand for energy resources exists, i.e. 3069 TWh of additional biomass was needed in the case of biofuels utilization scenario while 2775 TWh of electricity and 925 TWh of heat were needed in the case of renewable electrofuels produced using solid oxide electrolysis scenario.},

@article{Burd2021,
abstract = {Demand for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) has grown over the past decade as a result of climate action targets and energy policies globally. To improve driving range and minimize battery costs, BEV manufacturers have adopted lightweight materials with the objective of reducing energy requirements and enabling the use of smaller, less expensive batteries. However, improvements in battery energy density and electric motor technologies have enhanced vehicle performance and lowered costs independently. Thus, the need for expensive lightweight materials for mass savings could diminish as these technologies rapidly advance. This study evaluates lightweight material substitution cost tradeoffs and their changes over time for an advanced high strength steel and aluminum BEV design. Process-based cost modeling methods assess cost tradeoffs for body and closures and mass scaling estimations inform costs in the battery and motor, chassis, and other vehicle systems. Under current conditions, a steel design costs $595$ less per vehicle than aluminum, where steel's cost advantage is in body and closures manufacturing and aluminum's advantage is in battery, motor, and chassis manufacturing cost. As lightweighting advantages of battery and motor costs decline over time, the cost gap grows wider, with a $743$ per vehicle cost advantage for steel. These results underscore the importance of accounting for technological advancements and learning when projecting BEV costs. This material substitution decision ultimately has implications for energy systems and long-term profitability of BEV business models. As BEV performance and costs improve, there will be an increase in demand for BEVs, electricity, and charging infrastructure.},

abstract = {Battery electric vehicles with a range of more than 500 km are expected to become increasingly competitive in the future. The energy density of the currently available lithium batteries should be significantly increased to support the operation of such vehicles, and high-power charging is required to reduce the charging time. However, high-power charging may negatively affect the durability and safety of lithium batteries because of increased heat generation, capacity fading, and lithium plating, which can induce the risk of battery thermal runaway. Currently, there are no established boundary conditions for high-power charging or methods for evaluating its risks, especially in case of high-capacity lithium batteries. This study proposes a test procedure for examining the reaction characteristics of the capacity fading and thermal tolerance of lithium batteries that are subjected to high-power charging. Further, the migration characteristics of the temperature threshold of battery thermal runaway are investigated using the proposed procedure. The test results demonstrate that high-power charging significantly impacts the durability and thermal safety of the high-capacity lithium batteries. In particular, the capacity fading rate can reach up to 30\% only after 100 charge cycles depending on the battery type. Furthermore, the thermal tolerance can decrease up to 40\% by considering the change in the self-heating temperature as an indicator. Based on the study results, it can be concluded that the thermal management systems should be carefully designed to satisfy the high-power charging requirements. Otherwise, the high power charging only can be performed with limited range for battery electric cars with long all electric range.},

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are used widely to analyze energy system transitions over a decadal time frame to help inform and evaluating international climate policy. As part of this, IAMs also explore pathways of decarbonizing the transport sector. This study quantifies the contribution of changes in activity growth, modal structure, energy intensity and fuel mix to the projected passenger transport carbon emission pathways. The Laspeyres index decomposition method is used to compare results across models and scenarios, and against historical transport trends. Broadly-speaking the models show similar trends, projecting continuous transport activity growth, reduced energy intensity and in some cases modal shift to carbon-intensive modes - similar to those observed historically in a business-as-usual scenario. In policy-induced mitigation scenarios further enhancements of energy efficiency and fuel switching is seen, showing a clear break with historical trends. Reduced activity growth and modal shift (towards less carbon-intensive modes) only have a limited contribution to emission reduction. Measures that could induce such changes could possibly complement the aggressive, technology switch required in the current scenarios to reach internationally agreed climate targets.},

Based on this data, the share of BEV vehicle price that is related to the battery pack is modelled. To illustrate future progress we estimate when it is possible to produce a BEV with a 200 mile range in a given price percentile. We find that the price percentile where the price of a BEV is comparable to conventional cars changes in a nonlinear way when battery pack costs fall below 200–250 USD/kWh. Furthermore, we show that battery pack costs of 150 USD/kWh could imply that production costs of a BEV with a 200 mile range are cost competitive for almost 50\% of the US car market segments by 2020.

abstract = {Currently more and more attention is paid to energy consumption and it is especially noticeable in electric vehicles. Generally, when thinking about the idea of reducing the energy consumption in an electric vehicle there are two methods. The first one is introducing new technical solutions in the design for reducing energy consumption. The second way is driving and performing other maintenance tasks in a manner that reduce energy consumption. A special case of the use of these methods is with vehicles built specifically for energy efficient racing, where the criterion of energy saving is much more critical than in the ordinary, commercial vehicles. The task of ensuring minimum energy consumption during driving is quite demanding and the decisions taken as early as at the vehicle concept stage can have a great impact on the final result. The paper presents the experience of the Silesian University of Technology team gained while constructing the high-performance electric vehicles designed for Shell Ecomarathon, beginning with the selected methodology for the design of such vehicles by solving partial design ibues for some components of the vehicle as well as studies carried both on test stands and on the racetrack . Special attention was paid to the method of dealing with the determination when reducing the interaction of design features to evaluate their influence on the energy consumption. The second part of the paper deals with the evaluation of the driving strategy during the race and its impact on reducing the energy consumption. The method to determine the outcome of the set strategy and how to select the race strategy is presented along with the optimal strategy in specific structural and environmental constraints.

ABSTRACT = {We analyze daily charging demand patterns of electric vehicles at DC fast charging stations along the German autobahn for an average week in 2020. For this we develop an agent based simulation tool based on current empirical mobility data. Our results show that already in 2020 about 1,000 charging processes per charging location and day might be realistic. In order to avoid long waiting times these charging locations should be equipped with about 20 charging points. A utilization rate of up to 80% makes a profitable operation of these stations highly probable. A sensitivity analysis indicates main parameters which influence the throughput of electric vehicles significantly.},

abstract = {To date, real cost data for Electric Vehicle (EV) rapid charging infrastructure is largely missing in the literature, preventing development of economic models to encourage private investment and limiting policy decisions. A business model has been constructed using actual capital expenditure, operating costs and usage data from the Rapid Charge Network project (RCN) which can be used to assist future investment and policy decisions. The model is run under a wide spectrum of EV uptake scenarios to provide plausible answers to a variety of research, policy and investment questions, including minimum growth rates to break even under current policy. Using real-world data we have confirmed that a financial business opportunity does exist for investment in rapid chargers on main highways and have identified the operating area in which a profit can be made. However, since UK EV adoption is still at the Innovators stage in a niche market where innovations in technology, user practices, supporting infrastructure and functionality are still required to achieve wide user acceptance, the case is also made for continued fiscal incentives to encourage investment in rapid-charging infrastructure.},

abstract = {For a successful market take-up of plug-in electric vehicles, fast-charging stations along the highway network play a significant role. This paper provides results from a first study on estimating the minimum number of fast-charging stations along the European highway network of selected countries (i.e., France, Germany, the Benelux countries, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, the Czech Republic, and Poland) and gives an estimate on their future profitability. The combination of a comprehensive dataset of passenger car trips in Europe and an efficient arc-cover-path-cover flow-refueling location model allows generating results for such a comprehensive transnational highway network for the first time. Besides the minimum number of required fast-charging stations which results from the applied flow-refueling location model (FRLM), an estimation of their profitability as well as some country-specific results are also identified. According to these results the operation of fast-charging stations along the highway will be attractive in 2030 because the number of customers per day and their willingness to pay for a charge is high compared to inner-city charging stations. Their location-specific workloads as well as revenues differ significantly and a careful selection of locations is decisive for their economic operation.},

We present a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based on a novel integrated vehicle simulation framework, which allows for consistency in vehicle parameter settings and consideration of future technological progress. Conventional and hybrid gasoline, diesel and natural gas cars as well as battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEV and FCV) are analyzed, taking into account electricity and hydrogen production chains from fossil, nuclear and renewable energy resources.Our results show that a substantial mitigation of climate change can be obtained with electric passenger vehicles, provided that non-fossil energy resources are used for electricity and hydrogen production. However, in terms of other environmental burdens such as acidification, particulate matter formation, and toxicity, BEV may in some cases and FCV are likely to perform worse than modern fossil fueled cars as a consequence of emissions along vehicle and fuel production chains. Therefore, the electrification of road transportation should be accompanied by an integration of life cycle management in vehicle manufacturing chains as well as energy and transport policies in order to counter potential environmental drawbacks.},

@article{VanVliet2011,
abstract = {We examine efficiency, costs and greenhouse gas emissions of current and future electric cars (EV), including the impact from charging EV on electricity demand and infrastructure for generation and distribution. Uncoordinated charging would increase national peak load by 7% at 30% penetration rate of EV and household peak load by 54%, which may exceed the capacity of existing electricity distribution infrastructure. At 30% penetration of EV, off-peak charging would result in a 20% higher, more stable base load and no additional peak load at the national level and up to 7% higher peak load at the household level. Therefore, if off-peak charging is successfully introduced, electric driving need not require additional generation capacity, even in case of 100% switch to electric vehicles. GHG emissions from electric driving depend most on the fuel type (coal or natural gas) used in the generation of electricity for charging, and range between 0 g km-1 (using renewables) and 155 g km-1 (using electricity from an old coal-based plant). Based on the generation capacity projected for the Netherlands in 2015, electricity for EV charging would largely be generated using natural gas, emitting 35-77 g CO 2 eq km-1. We find that total cost of ownership (TCO) of current EV are uncompetitive with regular cars and series hybrid cars by more than 800 ¢ year-1. TCO of future wheel motor PHEV may become competitive when batteries cost 400 ¢ kWh-1, even without tax incentives, as long as one battery pack can last for the lifespan of the vehicle. However, TCO of future battery powered cars is at least 25% higher than of series hybrid or regular cars. This cost gap remains unless cost of batteries drops to 150 ¢ kWh-1 in the future. Variations in driving cost from charging patterns have negligible influence on TCO. GHG abatement costs using plug-in hybrid cars are currently 400-1400 ¢ tonne-1 CO2eq and may come down to -100 to 300 ¢ tonne-1. Abatement cost using battery powered cars are currently above 1900 ¢ tonne-1 and are not projected to drop below 300-800 tonne-1. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

But they also increasingly acknowledge the environmental and resource problems facing vehicular transport, particularly global climate change and oil depletion. In order to meet these challenges, researchers propose a variety of technological solutions, including greatly improved vehicular fuel efficiency, alternative fuels and propulsion systems, and carbon capture and storage. In this paper we question whether these optimistic solutions can be developed and widely deployed in the limited time frame available, and argue instead that not only are ever-rising vehicular mobility levels unlikely to occur, but that the human costs of continuing this approach are also too great. Instead we argue that because transport is a derived demand, we must first articulate a preferred vision of the future, then design an appropriate, sustainable transport system. Finally, we briefly outline what such a low-mobility future transport system would look like, using our own city, Melbourne, Australia, as a case study.}

abstract = {Public fast charging infrastructure (FCI) is essential for the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). To reach higher EV penetration, investments into the development of a comprehensive and widespread fast charging network are necessary. However, current investments in FCI are only profitable in specific locations resulting in a severe lack of deployments in most areas. The wish for rapid development of both, EVs and related charging opportunities, requires political support measures for FCI. This paper investigates various support measures regarding their contribution to a comprehensive expansion of FCI through profitability enhancement. We illustrate the impact of different support measures on the profitability of three different charging power categories at three different located charging sides along the German freeway. Besides the traffic volume, the profitability of FCI strongly depends on the location's surrounding charging facilities and population characteristics and decreases with increasing charging power. Currently available support measures such as investment subsidies or the exemption from the electricity tax do not contribute significantly to a widespread expansion of FCI. Changes in the demand charges have a higher potential to support nationwide investments in FCI.},

abstract = {Although barriers to the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), such as purchase price, range limitation, and charging infrastructure are diminishing, sales growth has still fallen short of industry expectations. As industry and governments have an interest in counteracting this negative trend by incentivizing EV purchasing, a better understanding of potential EV adopters and drivers of early adoption becomes paramount for designing effective and efficient incentive schemes. Therefore, drawing on a representative survey of Austrian citizens, this study analyzes early adopters, potential adopters, and non-adopters of EVs. Findings indicate that psychological and, to a lesser extent, socio-demographic factors play a significant role in predicting EV adoption. Non-adopters are more likely to have an individualistic and less egalitarian worldview, and also, compared to early adopters, to fall short in terms of pro-environmental and pro-technological attitude. Further, early adopters are inclined to live in regions with EV policy incentives. Using cluster analysis, this study identifies four groups of potential EV adopters based on their evaluation of EV purchasing and non-purchasing motives. The potential-adopter segments differ considerably in their socio-demographic and psychological characteristics, as well as in their preferences for policy incentives. We discuss implications of our findings for the design of effective policy schemes and marketing measures.}

abstract = {Staying within the 2 °C (preferably 1.5 °C) limit requires fast and fundamental system changes, also in urban passenger transport. Shifting car traffic to environmentally friendly transport modes is one central strategy to make urban transport more sustainable and climate friendly. However, in most cities car use remains high. Therefore, this paper analyzes what course change is needed regarding direction, scale and speed of change for urban sustainability and climate protection reasons. The paper analyzes the role of modal shift as a strategy in itself and in relation to land-use (avoid) and efficiency (improve) measures. The paper draws on insights from European frontrunning cities and explorative forecasting scenarios calculated with the sophisticated integrated land-use transport model “Ruhr Region 2050”. The paper suggests that a significant reduction of urban car use is needed (direction) that roughly equals a fast halving of car use (scale), which has proven feasible under the current socio-political conditions by annual reduction rates of 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points of the trip-based modal share of car use (speed). Significantly reducing car use requires comprehensive and high-intensive measures that go far beyond usual practices. Modal shift measures need to play a crucial role in integrated approaches with land-use (avoid) and efficiency (improve) measures because they have the potential to significantly reduce car use and CO2 emissions and because they can produce comparatively fast effects–which makes modal shift measures first aid approaches to achieve a fast “bending of the curve” of excessive car use and growing CO2 emissions.},

abstract = {The allocation of fast charging stations is a severe investment for the future mobility system with electric vehicles. The allocation of the first charging stations influences the profitability of all other fast charging stations and should therefore be perfectly arranged. Hence, we applied and extended the flow-refueling location model (FRLM) developed by Capar et al. (Eur J Oper Res 227(1):142–151, 2013) to the German autobahn with a focus on the states Baden-W{\"{u}}rttemberg and Bavaria with 595 nodes and 3569 highway km. Our model extension comprehends mainly the inclusion of the access distance for traffic participants to their closest network node. In order to analyze the impact of different vehicle ranges and the desired coverage of flows we defined four scenarios. The results indicate the significance of vehicle range and the desired coverage value. 20 optimally allocated fast charging stations along the highways lead already to a coverage of about 62 % (100 km vehicle range) or even 83 % (150 km vehicle range) of all trips. A complete coverage of trips requires at least 50 (150 km vehicle range), 77 (100 km vehicle range) or even 84 (70 km vehicle range) fast charging stations. The last 30 % coverage leads to a tripling of charging stations. Furthermore, a first estimation of the corresponding surcharge for fixed costs per charging process amounts to about 20 % of the total costs for a charging process.},

abstract = {Background: As electric kick scooters, three-wheelers, and passenger cars enter the streets, efficiency trade-offs across vehicle types gain practical relevance for consumers and policy makers. Here, we compile a comprehensive dataset of 428 electric vehicles, including seven vehicle types and information on certified and real-world energy consumption. Regression analysis is applied to quantify trade-offs between energy consumption and other vehicle attributes. Results: Certified and real-world energy consumption of electric vehicles increase by 60\% and 40\%, respectively, with each doubling of vehicle mass, but only by 5\% with each doubling of rated motor power. These findings hold roughly also for passenger cars whose energy consumption tends to increase 0.6 ± 0.1 kWh/100 km with each 100 kg of vehicle mass. Battery capacity and vehicle mass are closely related. A 10 kWh increase in battery capacity increases the mass of electric cars by 15 kg, their drive range by 40–50 km, and their energy consumption by 0.7–1.0 kWh/100 km. Mass-produced state-of-the-art electric passenger cars are 2.1 ± 0.8 kWh/100 km more efficient than first-generation vehicles, produced at small scale. Conclusion: Efficiency trade-offs in electric vehicles differ from those in conventional cars—the latter showing a strong dependency of fuel consumption on rated engine power. Mass-related efficiency trade-offs in electric vehicles are large and could be tapped by stimulating mode shift from passenger cars to light electric road vehicles. Electric passenger cars still offer potentials for further efficiency improvements. These could be exploited through a dedicated energy label with battery capacity as utility parameter.},

@article{Wager2016,
abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) have the potential to operate emission free and thus overcome many environmental and health issues associated with cars run on fossil fuels. Recharging time and driving range are amongst the biggest hurdles for the mainstream acceptance and implementation of EV technology. Fast-DC charging significantly reduces the recharging time and can be used to make longer EV trips possible, e.g. on highways between cities. Although some EV and hybrid car studies have been conducted that address separately issues such as limited drivable ranges, charge stations, impact from auxiliary loads on vehicle energy consumption and emissions, there is currently limited research on the impact on drivable range from the combination of driving EVs at highway speeds, using auxiliary loads such as heating or air conditioning (AC), and reduced charge capacity from fast-DC charging and discharge safety margins. In this study we investigate these parameters and their impact on energy consumption and drivable range of EVs. Our results show a significantly reduced range under conditions relevant for highway driving and significant deviation from driving ranges published by EV manufacturers. The results and outcomes of this project are critical for the efficient design and implementation of so-called 'Electric Highways'. To prevent stranded cars and a possible negative perception of EVs, drivers and charging infrastructure planners need be aware of how EV energy and recharging demands can significantly change under different loads and driving patterns.},

abstract = {European Union’s (EU) long-term objective of achieving a competitive low carbon economy is mainly based on enabling environmentally sustainable investments, particularly in terms of decreasing energy consumption in buildings, transition to electric vehicles, and developing smart electricity networks, while promoting renewable energy use in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 80\% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. Since, transport is one of the main sector responsible for EU’s emissions; diffusion of Electric Vehicles (EVs) could allow immense reduction. Therefore, since the announcement of 2050 Roadmap in 2009, there has been a great increase in studies exploring the viability of transition to e-mobility in a Europe-wide context, identifying common factors and variables. However, it is usually not that straightforward when decision makers seek to transform these variables into policy implications that will actually help to achieve the EU goals on energy transition. At this point, the motivators and barriers are of utmost importance. Accordingly, this study is based on an extensive and up-to-date review of the existing literature on e-mobility in Europe, with the main aim of identifying and mapping the motivators and barriers for the diffusion of electric mobility through three levels of decision-making: Formal Social Units, Collective Decision-Making Units, and Individual Units. Results of the analysis identifies that the main barriers are lack of charging infrastructure; economic restrictions and cost concerns; technical and operational restrictions; lack of trust; information and knowledge; limited supply of electricity and raw materials; and practicability concerns. Thus, key motivators appear to be environmental, economic and technical benefits associated with EVs, as well as personal and demographic factors.}

A coordinate transformation is adopted which circumvent the difficulty of predicting multimodal distribution with large variance differences between modes which is associated with the general regression neural network. The proposed technique trains the network in a way that the variance differences between modes is kept small and in the same order. Further, the technique reduces the number of indispensable training parameters to two parameters and lowers the load of the computation as well as the time for conditions in which employing separate values of $\sigma$ is unavoidable. The accuracy of the proposed technique is demonstrated by examining two different cases: the performance map of an axial compressor and the boundary layer profile over a flat plate. The results are compared with those by general regression neural network as well as the corresponding experimental data. Excellent improvement is obtained. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

@article{Baumgarte2021,
abstract = {Public fast charging infrastructure (FCI) is essential for the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). To reach higher EV penetration, investments into the development of a comprehensive and widespread fast charging network are necessary. However, current investments in FCI are only profitable in specific locations resulting in a severe lack of deployments in most areas. The wish for rapid development of both, EVs and related charging opportunities, requires political support measures for FCI. This paper investigates various support measures regarding their contribution to a comprehensive expansion of FCI through profitability enhancement. We illustrate the impact of different support measures on the profitability of three different charging power categories at three different located charging sides along the German freeway. Besides the traffic volume, the profitability of FCI strongly depends on the location's surrounding charging facilities and population characteristics and decreases with increasing charging power. Currently available support measures such as investment subsidies or the exemption from the electricity tax do not contribute significantly to a widespread expansion of FCI. Changes in the demand charges have a higher potential to support nationwide investments in FCI.},

abstract = {An appropriate charging infrastructure is one of the key aspects needed to support the mass adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and it is suggested that publically available fast chargers could play a key role in this infrastructure. As fast charging is a relatively new technology, very little research is conducted on the topic using real world datasets, and it is of utmost importance to measure actual usage of this technology and provide evidence on its importance to properly inform infrastructure planning. 90,000 fast charge events collected from the first large-scale roll-outs and evaluation projects of fast charging infrastructure in the UK and the US and 12,700 driving days collected from 35 BEVs in the UK were analysed. Using multiple regression analysis, we examined the relationship between daily driving distance and standard and fast charging and demonstrated that fast chargers are more influential. Fast chargers enabled using BEVs on journeys above their single-charge range that would have been impractical using standard chargers. Fast chargers could help overcome perceived and actual range barriers, making BEVs more attractive to future users. At current BEV market share, there is a vital need for policy support to accelerate the development of fast charge networks.}

How the mitigation potential of changes in mobility, dietary, housing or consumption behaviour compare to those of ambitious technological changes in terms of decarbonisation remains a key question. To evaluate the interplay of behaviour and technological changes, we make use of the European Calculator model and show that changes in behaviour may contribute more than 20\% of the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions required for net-zero by 2050. Behaviour and technology-oriented scenarios are tested individually and in combination for the EU plus the UK and Switzerland. The impacts of behavioural change vary across sectors, with significant GHG emission reduction potential and broader benefits. Changes in travel behaviour limit the rising demand for electricity, natural resources and infrastructure costs from the electrification of passenger transport. Adopting a healthy diet reduces emissions substantially compared to intensifying agricultural practices, while at the same time making cropland available for conservation or bioenergy crops. The trade-offs between energy and food may be substantially alleviated when deploying technological and behavioural changes simultaneously. The results suggest that without behavioural change, the dependency of Europe on carbon removal technologies for its net-zero ambitions increases. Structural changes will be necessary to achieve full decarbonisation by 2050, yet changes in lifestyles are crucial, contributing to achieving climate targets sooner.}

@article{Ajanovic2015,
abstract = {In recent years, about a century after reaching their first prime in the early 1900s, electric vehicles (EVs) have received growing attention again. Politicians in various countries have recognized EVs as a promising technological alternative to fossil fuel driven cars in combating global warming. However, for a broader market penetration considerable barriers have to be removed. The most important are high investment costs and low driving ranges, both caused by the major weakness of EVs-their battery. The core objective of this article is to investigate the future market prospects of various types of EVs, with the economics of EVs in comparison to conventional cars playing a key role. Only if the final driving costs can be considerably reduced will EVs gain significant market shares. In addition to this also the environmental aspects are very important because they are a major motivation in supporting and promotion of EVs. However, the policies and measures implemented vary between countries, meaning there is huge potential for an exchange of lessons learned. The major conclusion of this article is that future prospects of EVs are only bright if the costs of batteries can be brought down through technological learning and if improved storage can lead to higher driving ranges. However, to harvest the full environmental benefits of EVs the electricity for EVs must be generated from renewable energy sources. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley},

@article{Skarka2015,
abstract = {Currently more and more attention is paid to energy consumption and it is especially noticeable in electric vehicles. Generally, when thinking about the idea of reducing the energy consumption in an electric vehicle there are two methods. The first one is introducing new technical solutions in the design for reducing energy consumption. The second way is driving and performing other maintenance tasks in a manner that reduce energy consumption. A special case of the use of these methods is with vehicles built specifically for energy efficient racing, where the criterion of energy saving is much more critical than in the ordinary, commercial vehicles. The task of ensuring minimum energy consumption during driving is quite demanding and the decisions taken as early as at the vehicle concept stage can have a great impact on the final result. The paper presents the experience of the Silesian University of Technology team gained while constructing the high-performance electric vehicles designed for Shell Ecomarathon, beginning with the selected methodology for the design of such vehicles by solving partial design ibues for some components of the vehicle as well as studies carried both on test stands and on the racetrack . Special attention was paid to the method of dealing with the determination when reducing the interaction of design features to evaluate their influence on the energy consumption. The second part of the paper deals with the evaluation of the driving strategy during the race and its impact on reducing the energy consumption. The method to determine the outcome of the set strategy and how to select the race strategy is presented along with the optimal strategy in specific structural and environmental constraints. The paper summarizes a few year experience in the design and testing of two vehicles built for Shell Eco-marathon, which is world famous competition for Prototype and UrbanConcept electric battery powered vehicles.},

abstract = {Background: As electric kick scooters, three-wheelers, and passenger cars enter the streets, efficiency trade-offs across vehicle types gain practical relevance for consumers and policy makers. Here, we compile a comprehensive dataset of 428 electric vehicles, including seven vehicle types and information on certified and real-world energy consumption. Regression analysis is applied to quantify trade-offs between energy consumption and other vehicle attributes. Results: Certified and real-world energy consumption of electric vehicles increase by 60% and 40%, respectively, with each doubling of vehicle mass, but only by 5% with each doubling of rated motor power. These findings hold roughly also for passenger cars whose energy consumption tends to increase 0.6 ± 0.1 kWh/100 km with each 100 kg of vehicle mass. Battery capacity and vehicle mass are closely related. A 10 kWh increase in battery capacity increases the mass of electric cars by 15 kg, their drive range by 40–50 km, and their energy consumption by 0.7–1.0 kWh/100 km. Mass-produced state-of-the-art electric passenger cars are 2.1 ± 0.8 kWh/100 km more efficient than first-generation vehicles, produced at small scale. Conclusion: Efficiency trade-offs in electric vehicles differ from those in conventional cars—the latter showing a strong dependency of fuel consumption on rated engine power. Mass-related efficiency trade-offs in electric vehicles are large and could be tapped by stimulating mode shift from passenger cars to light electric road vehicles. Electric passenger cars still offer potentials for further efficiency improvements. These could be exploited through a dedicated energy label with battery capacity as utility parameter.},

abstract = {Currently, the electrification of passenger cars is seen as one of the key strategies for heading toward a sustainable transport system. Of special interest are battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which can enable significant emission reductions if electricity used is produced from renewable energy sources. However, mainly due to their high investment costs (retail purchase price) of BEVs, they are currently not economically competitive with conventional fossil-fueled vehicles without different supporting policy measures. This paper analyzes current costs and future prospects for BEVs compared to conventional petrol cars looking at the total costs of ownership. Furthermore, the future prospects are investigated considering technological learning for BEVs, CO2 taxes for fuels, and various other policy framework conditions such as rebates for the purchase of the BEVs. The major conclusions are as follows: (i) to improve the economics of BEVs, a very important aspect is the introduction of CO2-based fuel taxes; (ii) regarding economics, the second important aspect is the reduction of the investment costs of the BEVs due to technological learning, especially of the battery; (iii) in addition, the introduction of CO2-based registration taxes for the purchase of passenger cars makes sense; (iv) subsidies or rebates for the purchase of a BEV maybe a measure successful in the short term and helpful to stimulate technological learning; (v) by far, the highest uncertainty regarding the future prospects of BEVs is how fast technological learning will take place, especially for the battery, and how the future development of batteries will be. {\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors.

We assess 48 models available to consumers since 1997, collecting data on attributes, weight and vehicle prices. We also provide an analysis of recent progress in battery pack costs. Based on this data, the share of BEV vehicle price that is related to the battery pack is modelled. To illustrate future progress we estimate when it is possible to produce a BEV with a 200 mile range in a given price percentile. We find that the price percentile where the price of a BEV is comparable to conventional cars changes in a nonlinear way when battery pack costs fall below 200–250 USD/kWh. Furthermore, we show that battery pack costs of 150 USD/kWh could imply that production costs of a BEV with a 200 mile range are cost competitive for almost 50% of the US car market segments by 2020. Finally, the most critical conditions for this development are discussed and assessed by sensitivity analysis applying conservative values to our model.},

@article{Burd2021,
abstract = {Demand for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) has grown over the past decade as a result of climate action targets and energy policies globally. To improve driving range and minimize battery costs, BEV manufacturers have adopted lightweight materials with the objective of reducing energy requirements and enabling the use of smaller, less expensive batteries. However, improvements in battery energy density and electric motor technologies have enhanced vehicle performance and lowered costs independently. Thus, the need for expensive lightweight materials for mass savings could diminish as these technologies rapidly advance. This study evaluates lightweight material substitution cost tradeoffs and their changes over time for an advanced high strength steel and aluminum BEV design. Process-based cost modeling methods assess cost tradeoffs for body and closures and mass scaling estimations inform costs in the battery and motor, chassis, and other vehicle systems. Under current conditions, a steel design costs $595 less per vehicle than aluminum, where steel's cost advantage is in body and closures manufacturing and aluminum's advantage is in battery, motor, and chassis manufacturing cost. As lightweighting advantages of battery and motor costs decline over time, the cost gap grows wider, with a $743 per vehicle cost advantage for steel. These results underscore the importance of accounting for technological advancements and learning when projecting BEV costs. This material substitution decision ultimately has implications for energy systems and long-term profitability of BEV business models. As BEV performance and costs improve, there will be an increase in demand for BEVs, electricity, and charging infrastructure.},

abstract = {Battery electric vehicles with a range of more than 500 km are expected to become increasingly competitive in the future. The energy density of the currently available lithium batteries should be significantly increased to support the operation of such vehicles, and high-power charging is required to reduce the charging time. However, high-power charging may negatively affect the durability and safety of lithium batteries because of increased heat generation, capacity fading, and lithium plating, which can induce the risk of battery thermal runaway. Currently, there are no established boundary conditions for high-power charging or methods for evaluating its risks, especially in case of high-capacity lithium batteries. This study proposes a test procedure for examining the reaction characteristics of the capacity fading and thermal tolerance of lithium batteries that are subjected to high-power charging. Further, the migration characteristics of the temperature threshold of battery thermal runaway are investigated using the proposed procedure. The test results demonstrate that high-power charging significantly impacts the durability and thermal safety of the high-capacity lithium batteries. In particular, the capacity fading rate can reach up to 30% only after 100 charge cycles depending on the battery type. Furthermore, the thermal tolerance can decrease up to 40% by considering the change in the self-heating temperature as an indicator. Based on the study results, it can be concluded that the thermal management systems should be carefully designed to satisfy the high-power charging requirements. Otherwise, the high power charging only can be performed with limited range for battery electric cars with long all electric range.},

abstract = {Energy demand of a transport sector has constantly been increasing in the recent years, consuming one third of the total final energy demand in the European Union (EU) over the last decade. A transition of this sector towards sustainable one is facing many challenges in terms of suitable technology and energy resources. Especially challenging transition is envisaged for heavy-weight, long-range vehicles and airplanes. A detailed literature review was carried out in order to detect the current state of the research on clean transport sector, as well as to point out the gaps in the research. In order to calculate the resources needed for the transition towards completely renewable transport sector, four main alternatives to the current fossil fuel systems were assessed and their potential was quantified, i.e. biofuels, hydrogen, synthetic fuels (electrofuels) and electricity. Results showed that electric modes of transport have the largest benefits and should be the main aim of the transport transition. It was calculated that 72.3% of the transport energy demand on the EU level could be directly electrified by the technology existing today. For the remaining part of the transport sector a significant demand for energy resources exists, i.e. 3069 TWh of additional biomass was needed in the case of biofuels utilization scenario while 2775 TWh of electricity and 925 TWh of heat were needed in the case of renewable electrofuels produced using solid oxide electrolysis scenario.},

Smart charging of EVs is expected to enable larger penetration of EVs and renewable energy, lower the charging cost and offer better utilization of the grid infrastructure. Bidirectional EV chargers will pave the way for V2G technology where the EV can be used for energy arbitrage and demand-side management. Solar charging of EV will result in sustainable transportation and use of the EV battery as PV storage. On the other hand, stationary contactless charging and on-road inductive charging of EV will remove the necessity for any cables, eliminate range anxiety issues and pave the way for automated driving.

This study thus performed a scenario analysis using the Reykjavik capital area as a case study, developing a business-as-usual case and five additional “What-If” scenarios using the story-and-simulation approach, modelling and decomposing the effects of axis-based technological and behavioural/urban form changes, estimating both direct and indirect emissions for each scenario. Reykjavik provides an interesting case study as a city in which the electrical grid is already highly decarbonized and has a dominant car culture. Studying Reykjavik provides insight regarding the GHG impacts of an e-transition counter-balanced by high levels of car ownership. The results showed that while e-mobility development would lead to less direct emissions, in terms of total GHG emissions, changes to travel behaviour and urban form would lead to less total GHG emissions. However, this research highlights that even with an already decarbonized electrical grid, an integrated approach of the two axes changes would be required within cities to achieve deep levels of decarbonization.}

The climate mitigation strategies and supporting documents were obtained from 30 UK cities recommended by the Urban Audit Methodology. We show that 13 cities mention EVs in their strategies. Analysing EV registrations and the EV infrastructures that is provided by cities we found that there is no statistical difference in the number of charging points or EVs between the cities that have EVs as part of their climate change mitigation strategy and those that do not. It was shown that EV uptake was more generally associated with other factors (such as local vehicle population or income) rather than any documented EV/climate mitigation strategy. We demonstrate that local strategies are failing in achieving the much needed step change and make suggestions how to improve EV uptake as an even more radical thinking and policies may become necessary to achieve carbon reduction targets.}

Promoting walking and cycling has been recognised as one of the means of mitigating such negative effects. Various approaches have been taken to enhance walking and cycling levels and to reduce the use of automobiles. This paper examines the effectiveness of infrastructure interventions in promoting walking and cycling for transport. Two related sets of panel data, covering elapsed time periods of one and two years, were analysed to track changes in travel behaviour following provision of new walking and cycling infrastructure so that modal shift from private car use to walking and cycling can be investigated. Two types of exposure measures were tested: distance from the infrastructure (a measure of potential usage), and actual usage of the infrastructure. Only the latter measure was statistically significantly associated with modal shift. This in turn suggested that infrastructure provision was not a sufficient condition for modal shift, but may have been a necessary condition. Along with the use of new infrastructure, the loss of employment, higher education, being male and being part of the ethnic majority were consistently found to be significantly and positively associated with modal shift towards walking and cycling. The findings of this study support the construction of walking and cycling routes, but also suggest that such infrastructure alone may not be enough to promote active travel.}

It is asserted that this condition, termed carbon lock-in, creates persistent market and policy failures that can inhibit the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies despite their apparent environmental and economic advantages. The notion of a Techno-Institutional Complex is introduced to capture the idea that lock-in occurs through combined interactions among technological systems and governing institutions. While carbon lock-in provides a conceptual basis for understanding macro-level barriers to the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies, it also generates questions for standard economic modeling approaches that abstract away technological and institutional evolution in their elaboration. The question of escaping carbon lock-in is left for a future paper.}

abstract = {This paper addresses less recognised factors which influence the diffusion of a particular technology. While an innovation’s attributes and performance are paramount, many fail because of external factors which favour an alternative. This paper, with theoretic input from diffusion, lock-in and path-dependency, presents a qualitative study of external factors that influenced the evolution of transportation in USA. This historical account reveals how one technology and its emergent systems become dominant while other choices are overridden by socio-political, economic and technological interests which include not just the manufacturing and service industries associated with the automobile but also government and market stakeholders. Termed here as a large socio-economic regime (LSER), its power in ensuring lock-in and continued path-dependency is shown to pass through three stages, weakening eventually as awareness improves. The study extends to transport trends in China, Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia and they all show the dominant role of an LSER. As transportation policy is increasingly accountable to address both demand and environmental concerns and innovators search for solutions, this paper presents important knowledge for innovators, marketers and policy makers for commercial and societal reasons, especially when negative externalities associated with an incumbent transportation technology may lead to market failure.}

ABSTRACT = {One of the barriers facing the electric vehicle market is the incremental cost of the vehicles. However, many of the benefits of electric vehicles are not well understood and are omitted from cost-benefit analyses. These benefits relate to human health, air quality and the environment, economic growth, and grid resilience. VEIC conducted a study to identify the broad range of benefits that electric vehicles provide and, where sufficient data exists, developed estimates to quantify these benefits. Assessing the value of these benefits provides guidance for policy-makers to determine incentive and investment levels that accurately reflect the full value of electric vehicles to society.},

Two classic causalities are dealt with: spatial dynamics influencing mobility; and mobility leading to certain forms of spatial dynamics. Very often the interaction between mobility and spatial dynamics is neglected by public authorities. Spatial planning, real estate development, infrastructure planning and transport policy have to be integrated within and between public bodies. In addition, public–private partnerships must be welcomed to promote synergy between mobility and spatial dynamics. Finally, the complicated relationship between mobility and spatial dynamics is an important topic for the future research agenda.}

abstract = {The European Commission introduced carbon dioxide emission standards on cars as an obligation to manufacturers in an aim to reduce carbon footprint of passenger cars in EU transportation. Car industry adjusting to a standard targeting 95 gCO2/km by 2020 is already marketing increasingly low CO2 emitting technologies. In the context of a strong emission cut strategy until 2050 the EU could adopt CO2 car standards at the levels of 20 gCO2/km. The aim of this paper is to explore more optimistic CO2 targets on passenger cars in the medium and the long term by using the PRIMES-TREMOVE energy economic transport model covering the EU-27 countries. In our study, we quantify two policy scenarios implementing more optimistic carbon emission targets at a different pace and we derive policy conclusions in terms of costs, emissions and energy by comparing them with a Reference scenario. The analysis shows a restructuring of the EU car fleet, leading to significant reductions in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption driven by a high penetration of advanced vehicle technologies in the long term. We find that if policymakers intend to pursue more optimistic carbon emission standards then the advanced vehicle technologies will prevail, albeit at an increase in user costs. CO2 emission targets can potentially be a key policy towards sustainable low carbon EU road private passenger transportation, if a decarbonisation strategy is employed.},

abstract = {This paper shows the importance of including region-specific circumstances in long-term climate change mitigation strategies, by example of a modeling exercise of the transport sector. Important emission reduction options in the transport sector include biofuels, electric vehicles and efficiency standards. The most effective combination of these options depends, among others, on the availability of biofuels, the effectiveness of efficiency standards, and the (expected) emission intensity of the power sector—all of which differ between regions. Differences in climate policies between regions influence these factors. For instance, fuel efficiency standards slowdown the long-term transition in regions where plugin hybrid electric cars compete with gasoline cars (such as the USA or Europe) by decreasing the costs for driving gasoline costs and therefore in fact increase long-term emissions. Another example is that promoting electric vehicles is less effective in regions which are expected to rely heavily on fossil fuels for power generation, such as South Africa, China and India. Based on these findings from the TIMER energy model, we introduce an indicative region-specific framework for assessing mitigation strategies for the transport sector up to 2050, for different ambition levels of climate policy.},

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are used widely to analyze energy system transitions over a decadal time frame to help inform and evaluating international climate policy. As part of this, IAMs also explore pathways of decarbonizing the transport sector. This study quantifies the contribution of changes in activity growth, modal structure, energy intensity and fuel mix to the projected passenger transport carbon emission pathways. The Laspeyres index decomposition method is used to compare results across models and scenarios, and against historical transport trends. Broadly-speaking the models show similar trends, projecting continuous transport activity growth, reduced energy intensity and in some cases modal shift to carbon-intensive modes - similar to those observed historically in a business-as-usual scenario. In policy-induced mitigation scenarios further enhancements of energy efficiency and fuel switching is seen, showing a clear break with historical trends. Reduced activity growth and modal shift (towards less carbon-intensive modes) only have a limited contribution to emission reduction. Measures that could induce such changes could possibly complement the aggressive, technology switch required in the current scenarios to reach internationally agreed climate targets.}

@article{Milovanoff2021,
abstract = {Urban passenger land transport is an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, but it is challenging to mitigate these emissions as this sector interacts with many other economic sectors. We develop the Climate change constrained Urban passenger Transport Integrated Life cycle assessment (CURTAIL) model to outline mitigation pathways of urban passenger land transport that are consistent with ambitious climate targets. CURTAIL uses the transport activity of exogenously defined modal shares to simulate the associated annual vehicle stocks, sales, and life cycle GHG emissions. It estimates GHG emission budgets that are consistent with global warming below 2 and 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels and seeks mitigation strategies to remain within the budgets. We apply it to a case study of Singapore, a city-state. Meeting a 1.5 °C target requires strong commitments in the transport and electricity sectors, such as reducing the motorized passenger activity, accelerating the deployment of public transit and of electrification, and decarbonizing the power generation system. Focusing on one mitigation technology or one mode of transport alone will not be sufficient to meet the target. Our novel model could be applied to any city to provide insights relevant to the design of urban climate change mitigation targets and policies.},

However, range anxiety, limited range, long charging time, and insufficient charging infrastructure have affected EVs' adoption. High-end batteries and chargers can decrease the charging demand and charging time, respectively, and increase the EVs' market share. Based on a recently developed intercity model, this study investigates the potential impact of different battery and charger technologies on the optimal configuration of charging infrastructure for the Michigan intercity network in 2030. The major contribution of this study is not only considering the effects of a variety of technology advancements on infrastructure requirements but also developing a realistic modeling framework with the consideration of the intercity network of Michigan, using realistic assumptions and parameters calibrated through multiple stakeholders' meetings. Therefore, the parameters and findings of this study can be used for future studies requiring realistic data. This study finds that the location of charging stations merely depends on the battery capacity while the charging power dictates the required number of chargers. Furthermore, high-tech charging infrastructures showed to be the cheaper option compared to low-tech ones.},

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) were recently reintroduced to the global car market. These are an improvement over their predecessors in performance and electric driving range. Although the uptake of EVs has been notable in a short period of time, most government goals for adoption have not been met. This paper reviews a growing body of peer-reviewed literature assessing factors affecting EV adoption. Several important gaps in knowledge are identified. First, there is mixed evidence of the effectiveness of government incentives in encouraging EV uptake and particularly little knowledge in regards to issues of timing and magnitude. The literature shows that public charging infrastructure is an important factor associated with EV uptake, though the direction of causality is yet unclear. Public charging infrastructure can ease range anxiety, particularly for battery electric vehicles, but there is little guidance as to the way in which government should best go about ensuring the provision of infrastructure. Lastly, the nascent EV market means that studies primarily rely on surveys about hypothetical situations. There is strong evidence that actual purchases are much lower than consumers' stated preferences. Improving understanding of this “attitude–action” gap is important to better informing studies of EV uptake over time.},

@article{Levy2020,
abstract = {The recent COVID-19 crisis has heightened the urgency of transitioning to a fully electrified transportation sector as one of the keys to unlocking a more sustainable future for all. Replacing gas-guzzling cars with zero emissions electric vehicles (EVs) will not only help slash smog-forming pollution and curtail greenhouse gas emissions, it is also critical to protect human health. The good news is that with more than one million electric vehicles on the road across the U.S., the EV market is at an inflection point as costs are poised to decline thanks to continued innovation and scaling. To achieve full electrification, there are three primary elements that are each distinctly important while also deeply interrelated: (1) reduced battery cost, (2) enhanced battery performance, and (3) ubiquitous charging infrastructure. While many EV drivers will do a combination of charging at home, work, and on the go, it's estimated that the U.S. EV market will require as many as 45,000 DC fast chargers by 2025 to enable widespread EV adoption-a threefold growth from the approximately 13,000 DCFC available today, of which approximately 5,500 DCFC are available on public charging networks. Fast charging enables drivers to integrate their charging into their everyday lives and instills range confidence. This paper examines ways that public and private stakeholders can work together to better understand and tackle the oft-overlooked costs and benefits of public fast charging infrastructure that is accessible to all. While electricity remains the largest cost driver, the full stack of costs also includes equipment at the early stage of a technology adoption curve, construction and installation costs, ongoing networking and maintenance costs, among other factors. 2},

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) have the potential to operate emission free and thus overcome many environmental and health issues associated with cars run on fossil fuels. Recharging time and driving range are amongst the biggest hurdles for the mainstream acceptance and implementation of EV technology. Fast-DC charging significantly reduces the recharging time and can be used to make longer EV trips possible, e.g. on highways between cities. Although some EV and hybrid car studies have been conducted that address separately issues such as limited drivable ranges, charge stations, impact from auxiliary loads on vehicle energy consumption and emissions, there is currently limited research on the impact on drivable range from the combination of driving EVs at highway speeds, using auxiliary loads such as heating or air conditioning (AC), and reduced charge capacity from fast-DC charging and discharge safety margins. In this study we investigate these parameters and their impact on energy consumption and drivable range of EVs. Our results show a significantly reduced range under conditions relevant for highway driving and significant deviation from driving ranges published by EV manufacturers. The results and outcomes of this project are critical for the efficient design and implementation of so-called 'Electric Highways'. To prevent stranded cars and a possible negative perception of EVs, drivers and charging infrastructure planners need be aware of how EV energy and recharging demands can significantly change under different loads and driving patterns.},

This paper reviews the advances of EVs regarding battery technology trends, charging methods, as well as new research challenges and open opportunities. More specifically, an analysis of the worldwide market situation of EVs and their future prospects is carried out. Given that one of the fundamental aspects in EVs is the battery, the paper presents a thorough review of the battery technologies—from the Lead-acid batteries to the Lithium-ion. Moreover, we review the different standards that are available for EVs charging process, as well as the power control and battery energy management proposals. Finally, we conclude our work by presenting our vision about what is expected in the near future within this field, as well as the research aspects that are still open for both industry and academic communities.},

@article{Baresch2019,
abstract = {The availability of charging infrastructure forms the basis for the enforced market penetration of electric cars. This paper aims to examine the distribution of the allocation of future charges to the various types of charging stations in order to provide a starting point for the evaluation of the need for charging infrastructure, i.e. its number, design and cost-effectiveness. For the case study of Austria, a new approach to derive the allocation of charging processes is applied by using demographic variables and decision rules. As a result, it is found that 88% of the charges are conducted when the user is at home, which is in line with literature. Significantly, fewer charges, approx. 8.8%, are carried out at the workplace. It is a relevant finding of this work relativizing the importance of workplace charging. Only 1.7% are conducted at ‘public charging infrastructure' (e.g. public car parks, supermarkets, etc.; note that also charging at assigned and freely selectable parking lots when the owner is at home is considered home charging) and 1.5% are conducted at ‘fast charging infrastructure' (i.e. motorways). It is observed that ‘public charging infrastructure' is only used for a small proportion of the charges. In conclusion, it can be deduced that some ‘public' or fast charging stations are unable to recover their costs through charging processes but are subject to other business models.},

A sizable body of research investigates influences of urban form on travel behavior, but few European studies illustrate variation of these influences across multiple cities and countries using disaggregated data. Here, we compare car ownership and mobility patterns, and we use gradient boosting decision tree and regression models to investigate urban form influences on travel distances, vehicle ownership, and mode choice across nineteen diverse European cities. Residential proximity to the city center is the urban form feature with greatest predictive importance for trip distances, car ownership and car mode choice. The exponential reduction of car use with higher population density is clearly demonstrated with aggregate city data. We detect nonlinear relationships between urban form and modelled outcomes, identify urban form thresholds for sustainable mobility, and suggest targeted policy interventions.}

abstract = {Potential carbon neutrality of the global trucking, shipping and aviation sectors by 2050 could be achieved by substituting fossil fuels with renewable hydrogen and synthetic fuels. To investigate the economic impact of fuel substitution over time, a holistic cost model is developed and applied to three case studies in Norway, an early adopter of carbon-neutral freight transport. The model covers the value chains from local electricity and fuel production (hydrogen, ammonia, Fischer–Tropsch e-fuel) to fuel consumption for long-haul trucking, short-sea shipping and mid-haul aviation. The estimates are internally consistent and allow cross-mode and cross-fuel comparisons that set this work apart from previous studies more narrowly focused on a given transport mode or fuel. The model contains 150 techno-economic parameters to identify which components along the value chains drive levelized costs. This paper finds a cost reduction potential for renewable fuels of 41% to 68% until 2050, but carbon-neutral transport will suffer asymmetric cost disadvantages. Fuel substitution is most expensive in short-sea shipping, followed by mid-haul aviation and long-haul trucking. Cost developments of electricity, direct air capture of carbon, vehicle expenses, and fuel-related payload losses are significant drivers.}

abstract = {The exhaustive nature of fossil fuels and environmental concerns associated with greenhouse gases are the major causes of the paradigm shift from conventional vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). The electrification of the transportation sector and the increasing popularity of the EVs have driven scientists and researchers to delve into charging stations. Underdeveloped charging infrastructure, optimal placement of charging stations, and charge scheduling in the charging stations are the major concerns for the large-scale deployment of EVs. Even few questions related to EVs, such as the vehicle price and driving range, can be partially solved with a well-developed charging infrastructure. Existing old infrastructure may bring severe limitations in the realization of the optimal placement of charging stations as EVs have not existed when the road and grid infrastructure have been developed. For the past few years, the studies associated with the optimal placement and sizing of EV charging stations have drawn the consideration of the researchers. The researchers have used different approaches, objective functions, and applied different optimization algorithms while dealing with the problem of charging station placement. The complex and dynamic nature of the problem has led researchers to apply different optimization algorithms for the solution of the problem. In this particular review study, the research works bearing on the charging infrastructure planning for the EVs are considered. Thus, this review work will endow the research community with the latest developments and research findings in the paradigm of charging infrastructure planning for EVs.

While greater density of public charging stations is correlated with higher BEV adoption, the mechanisms underlying this effect are not well understood. We use a sample of 1467 online survey respondents living in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Atlanta in the United States to investigate three potential mechanisms through which greater public charging station density could shape BEV adoption intent. These three potential mechanisms are lower range anxiety, lower perceived mobility restriction, and more positive pro-BEV subjective norms. Multiple regression with ordinary least squares is used to investigate associations between charging station density and adoption intent. Multiple mediation analysis is then used to evaluate the three potential mechanisms for impact of charging station density on BEV adoption intent, and indicates that greater perceived subjective norms in support of BEVs explain much of the association between charger density and adoption intent. Range anxiety plays a smaller and less robust role as a mechanism, while perceived mobility restriction has no direct or indirect effect on BEV adoption intent. That is, we found no indication that BEV adoption intent is influenced by expectations that BEVs are unable to meet mobility needs. Findings indicate that norms are particularly important for investments in charging infrastructure to translate to more BEVs on the road.}

To monitor changes in attitudes and behaviours and to estimate the impact of project activities, surveys with BEV and conventional car users were conducted in 2017, 2018, and 2019. We found that attitudes and driving behaviour of BEV users and non-users remained quite stable. While car users in Denmark and Sweden showed similar profiles, one exception was a more negative evaluation of and higher uncertainty about political support for BEVs by Danes. Modelling purchase intention, we found a significant effect of the new fast chargers in Denmark but not in Sweden, while the opposite was the case for information campaigns. Lifestyle compatibility and symbolic-affective attitudes were relevant for BEV adoption in both countries. For cross-border trips, the most relevant factor was whether people had a Tesla or not, reflecting the better driving range and fast charging infrastructure. An increase of charging infrastructure, clearer policy signals and symbolic-affective marketing are discussed as ways to increase BEV adoption.}

abstract = {The use of Battery Electric Vehicles is one of the biggest transformations in the field of sustainable development, holding the potential to address many sustainability challenges. Despite their high energy efficiency, the utilisation of these vehicles remains largely underexplored due to several factors. One of the prominent factors is the phenomenon of range anxiety (RA). This review aims to provide an overview of the range anxiety phenomenon, identifying its primary influencing variables and strategies for mitigating it. The review places particular emphasis on the methodologies and tools employed for assessing range anxiety and related factors. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and APA PsycInfo, using the following keywords: “range” AND (“stress” OR “anxiety”) AND ALL (“electric” AND “vehicle”). The protocol was registered with OSF, registration number is https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FN4VW. The articles were selected by two independent authors. The methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed. A total of 17 studies were included in the systematic review. Studies were analysed by sample size, conceptual framework, assessment method and results. The findings highlight that an approach grounded in Human-Factors principles and psychological metrics can significantly contribute to addressing range anxiety. More, individual (level of experience, self-efficacy, threatening perceptions, attitude, technology commitment and personality) and interface features (range estimation, State of Charge, adaptability, GPS, charging points map, road information) have a role in influencing the EV usage and the onset of RA. Among the commonly employed methods for assessing range anxiety were questionnaires (PASA), scenario-based analyses, and behavioral observations (including facial expression and gaze analysis). This review shows that the best solution to reduce the range anxiety may be to design improvements that minimize alterations to lifestyle and behaviour in comparison to the traditional vehicle. The most effective approach for mitigating range anxiety might involve designing improvements that minimise disruptions to lifestyle and behaviours when compared to traditional vehicles. As a novel contribution, this research presents a diagram illustrating the significant relationships between range anxiety and individual, socio-technical, and Human-Factors variables.}

Our study aims at estimating the extent to which an increasing availability of public charging infrastructure promotes consumers decisions to switch to EVs. We make use of a German data set including monthly registrations of new cars at the ZIP-code level between 2012 and 2017 and match it with the official registry of charging stations. We measure charging infrastructure by its quantity, capacity and abundance in order to estimate its impact on EV adoption. A dynamic heterogeneous panel approach is deployed in order to identify the structural long-run relationship between charging infrastructure and monthly EV registrations. We find evidence of a positive long-run relationship (and also of a causal link) but on a rather low scale. We conclude that consumers do not necessarily react to the mere number of public chargers but attach more importance to charging speed and are to a large extent influenced by unobservable common factors.}

However, externalities including the appropriability of knowledge and pollution abatement result in societal/economic benefits that are not incorporated in electric vehicle prices. In order to address resulting market failures, governments have employed a number of policies. We seek to determine the relationship of one such policy instrument (consumer financial incentives) to electric vehicle adoption. Based on existing literature, we identified several additional socio-economic factors that are expected to be influential in determining electric vehicle adoption rates. Using multiple linear regression analysis, we examined the relationship between those variables and 30 national electric vehicle market shares for the year 2012. The model found financial incentives, charging infrastructure, and local presence of production facilities to be significant and positively correlated to a country׳s electric vehicle market share. Results suggest that of those factors, charging infrastructure was most strongly related to electric vehicle adoption. However, descriptive analysis suggests that neither financial incentives nor charging infrastructure ensure high electric vehicle adoption rates.}

abstract = {The transport sector is one of the largest contributors to the greenhouse gas emissions, therefore the governments of EU member states have introduced a variety of measures to encourage people to transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), with incentives being the most common. Over the 2020–2022 period, individual incentives in Croatia for the purchase of new BEV were the second highest in Europe, but a decrease in the amount of incentives is expected, as it has already happened in Slovenia. This study contains results and analysis of surveys conducted among 278 BEV owners in Croatia and Slovenia. This is particularly significant because research focuses on two Southeast European countries that are adopting BEVs at different rates from the rest of Europe (mostly in the early adopter stage). The research showed that the early adoption of BEV is associated with higher education level and income of BEV owners, ownership of a house or garage, and is motivated mainly by lower maintenance costs, as well as long-term savings (in Croatia) and environmental aspects (in Slovenia). For the majority of BEV owners, the incentives for BEVs are the necessary precondition for making the decision to purchase a BEV, however, the minimal amount of incentives varies. The biggest disadvantages of BEVs in Croatia are uncertainty about availability of charging stations and in second place higher purchase prices compared to internal combustion engines vehicles, which is on the first place for Slovenia. The higher price could be offset by funding schemes or commercial bank loans. Since regular accessibility to charging stations is an important prerequisite for the decision to purchase a BEV, measures for increasing and improving charging stations accessibility are proposed. Besides, policy implications are given, with a proposal for improvement of incentives procedures, and recommendations for future research.}

This research note develops the main aspects of the carbon lock-in in the plastics industry and how it extends into many aspects of contemporary life. With data collected from trade press and reports, we present insights of the investment trends in the plastics industry from the past decade. We show that among the twelve largest companies 88 new projects for production capacity increase and infrastructure expansion were announced between 2012 and 2019. We connect this increasing infrastructural lock-in to actions and strategies enacted by the industry to restrict regulations on the use of plastics and support specific consumer behaviour to uphold also an institutional and behavioural lock-in. The paper outlines the need for more extensive research on the plastics and petrochemical sectors, especially regarding data from Asian companies and activities in China in particular. We also point to areas of grave concern for new policy, aiming to reduce the high growth rate for the volumes of oil and gas that feed the industry as the current focus on plastic waste collection and recycling is insufficient.}

Although alternatives to internal combustion engine vehicles are already on the market, without extensive political support, electric vehicle (EV) adoption remains low. Understanding the drivers of adoption of alternative technologies is key to develop effective measures to accelerate their diffusion. This paper presents individual consumer characteristics and home-location based spatial characteristics of current battery electric vehicle (BEV) and internal combustion engine vehicle holders, in a region free from strong EV policies. Using a generalized linear mixed-effects logistic model on this revealed preference data, we find that BEV adoption is predicted by technology affinity, high income, green party preferences, and living in one’s own house. Altogether, the study offers insights on the characteristics of early adopters of BEVs that can be valuable to policymakers, energy grid and charging infrastructure operators, as well as the automotive industry.}

Using hierarchical regression analysis, we examine the impacts of six dimensions relating to socio-demographic, technical, economic, and behavioral factors in a survey (n = 4885) across Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Our results show that younger males, with higher income, a higher number of children, and who had experiences with EVs, and generally hold sustainability values are positively related to potential EV adoption. Among electric mobility attributes, vehicle-to-grid capability and charging time are determined to be the influential predictors. Adding vehicle-to-grid capability can foster EV adoption in our analysis, considering it can add a revenue stream for EV owners. Individuals continue to use specific knowledge of conventional fuel vehicles when considering EVs and their attributes. Among all of our factors, the fuel economy, financial savings, and environmental value were the strongest predictors. In comparison, the driving range was ranked less critical to former EV owners than to a conventional car and current EV owners. Battery life was ranked more important to conventional fuel vehicle owners than current and former EV owners. Finally, former EV owners considered vehicle-to-grid to be more important than current EV and conventional car owners, implying that vehicle-to-grid could be the marginal incentive that would be the “tipping point.”}

This paper aims to examine the distribution of the allocation of future charges to the various types of charging stations in order to provide a starting point for the evaluation of the need for charging infrastructure, i.e. its number, design and cost-effectiveness. For the case study of Austria, a new approach to derive the allocation of charging processes is applied by using demographic variables and decision rules. As a result, it is found that 88% of the charges are conducted when the user is at home, which is in line with literature. Significantly, fewer charges, approx. 8.8%, are carried out at the workplace. It is a relevant finding of this work relativizing the importance of workplace charging. Only 1.7% are conducted at ‘public charging infrastructure’ (e.g. public car parks, supermarkets, etc.; note that also charging at assigned and freely selectable parking lots when the owner is at home is considered home charging) and 1.5% are conducted at ‘fast charging infrastructure’ (i.e. motorways). It is observed that ‘public charging infrastructure’ is only used for a small proportion of the charges. In conclusion, it can be deduced that some ‘public’ or fast charging stations are unable to recover their costs through charging processes but are subject to other business models.}

The qualitative assessment consists of a literature review of existing studies about EV charging behaviour and an analysis of semi-structured interviews with Danish EV users. This assessment identifies the most relevant factors for charging. In addition, it highlights that the time horizon of the charging decision is an essential factor. We use this to design two stated-choice (SC) experiments explicitly taking these findings into account. The first SC experiment looks into long-term decisions related to regular charging practices. The second SC experiment captures decisions related to occasional charging needs on longer trips. The SC data consist of three responses from 558 EV owners for each of the two experiments. We model the data using mixed logit models to allow for unobserved heterogeneity and the repeated nature of the SC data. The main findings indicate a high preference for all-inclusive/flat fee pricing structures. Moreover, they show that respondents value interoperability between charging networks, both nationally and internationally. Related to occasional charging, we find willingness-to-pay measures describing the detour respondents are willing to drive to obtain lower costs, a higher likelihood of available chargers, and facilities at the charging location. Overall the analyses highlight many factors that influence the charging decisions of consumers that are relevant for policymakers and charging operators. In addition, they highlight the barriers in a charging context, such as network roaming, lack of charging etiquette, and congestion at chargers.}

abstract = {This study is motivated by the need to understand what the most appropriate policies are to promote battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in various countries around the world. A systematic review of reviews on policies promoting BEVs was conducted to synthesise knowledge on the relative effectiveness of various policies. This study addresses three limitations in existing research on policies to promote electric vehicles (EVs). Firstly, it disentangles findings for BEVs from that of other EVs. Secondly, it examines the relative effectiveness of these policies to find optimal policy mixes. Finally, it compares policy effectiveness across nations at various stages of economic development and EV adoption. Purchase subsidies and tax incentives were found to be highly effective policies to kickstart EV adoption but may not be as effective at later stages of the EV adoption and may not be an affordable policy for all countries. Some countries that led the way with such subsidies and tax incentives have now begun curtailing or ceasing them, and contrary to earlier reviews, without serious adverse effect on adoption rates. Policies supporting public charging infrastructure are crucial enablers that complement EV purchase subsidies but are important even without purchase subsidies in place. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane access and toll waivers are the next most effective demand side policies, but only in cities where such incentives make sense and cents for consumers. Supply side policies, such as zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates and vehicle emissions standards, must match or precede demand side policies to avoid bottlenecks and effectively drive uptake of BEVs in the earliest stage of adoption.}

abstract="Environmental taxes and oil market fluctuations can increase road fuel prices significantly and are likely to play a big role in the future. This raises social justice issues, as some low-income households rely on cars for access to services and opportunities but struggle to afford related expenses. The impacts of fuel price increases are unevenly spatially distributed, as shown by transport, planning and urban research. We investigate spatial patterns of vulnerability to fuel price increases in Italy, a country where the problem is particularly pronounced due to high motorisation rate relative to income, and high fuel prices. We define vulnerability as the combination of high exposure (high car use), high sensitivity (low income) and low adaptive capacity (high car dependence). Based on municipality-level data on motorisation and the journey to work from the 2011 Italian Census and official income tax revenue data for 2012 (as a proxy for income) we derive a composite indicator of vulnerability. The results show: i) a co-location of low-income and high car use on the periphery of many Italian city regions; ii) stark interregional differences, with lower income levels in the South driving high levels of vulnerability, despite lower levels of car ownership and use.",

Two different cases were identified: placement in a city network (urban road network) and in a regional or national network (rural roads and highways). For a city and a regional network, the methodology identifies high-potential areas for the installation of charging station. In contrast, for a highway network the methodology provides explicitly the suggested locations: the charging stations should preferably be placed in already built areas, gas stations or rest areas, to minimize additional investment costs. A pilot study was made for the city of Bolzano/Bozen (city road network) and the province of Alto Adige/Südtirol (rural and highway network).

However, these models struggle to address several critical elements necessary for strategic planning, such as the development and adoption of new fuel technologies over time, inertia in transport fleets, and uncertainty surrounding future transport costs. In this paper, we develop a strategic network design model, named STraM, that explicitly incorporates these key factors. STraM, being a two-stage stochastic program, effectively handles long-term uncertainty by considering different future scenarios in its decision-making process.It provides a network design plan that includes infrastructure investments and fuel technology decisions, aiming to achieve cost-effective decarbonization of the freight transport system. The model output can be used as input for higher-resolution national freight transport models to yield results with greater operational detail. We demonstrate the application of STraM through a case study of Norway, offering valuable insights into the strategic planning of decarbonizing freight transport.}

This study analyzes the costs of strategic fleet replacement through a mixed integer linear program. Comparing three Norwegian transport operators, we determine cost-optimal investments in fossil and renewable fuel technologies for two approaches: One integrating and the other neglecting sustainability commitments. Our findings reveal that the truck operator’s sustainability commitments incur minimal additional costs, with battery-electric trucks proving cost-effectiveness early. In contrast, ship and airplane operators exhibit significant differences in fleet replacement decisions, resulting in additional costs ranging from +6% to +31% for ships and +4% to +11% for airplanes, across fuel cost and carbon price scenarios. Norwegian carbon price regulations fall short in incentivizing a cost-competitive technology transition for ships and airplanes. Additional policies are needed to encourage gradual fleet replacement.}

This kind of problem has been studied for several researchers who look for solutions to the large numbers of problems relating on the transport systems like: traffic jam, pollution, delays, among others. In this work are presented a standard mathematical formulation for this problem and some other variations, which make the problem more complex and harder to be solved. There are many approaches to solve it that are found in the literature and they are divided according to classical methods and soft computing methodologies, which combine approximate reasoning as fuzzy logic and functional as metaheuristics and neural networks. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages that are also shown. A novel approach to solve the multimodal transport network problem in fuzzy environment is developed and this approach is also applied in a theoretical problem to illustrate its effectiveness.",

This research examines the affordability of EVs for Irish households, focusing on equity implications and the impact of affordability on achieving decarbonisation goals. Affordability is estimated for eight scenarios, considering both current and reduced EV prices, and assessed across Ireland. The research finds that flat-rate subsidies do not adequately support lower-income households, impede EV adoption, and could jeopardise the achievement of emission reduction targets. Need-based subsidies would ensure more inclusive EV uptake. If current prices are considered, the target for the number of EVs on the road by 2030 can be met only with the purchase of small-sized EVs. This suggests that achieving EV targets is unlikely without promoting smaller vehicles. The current €3500 EV grant may be insufficient for many households without extended loan terms. Therefore, differentiated subsidies based on income and household size are recommended to increase EV adoption. Households in remote rural areas, where forced car ownership is high, require higher subsidies. In contrast, urban areas could receive lower subsidies to promote the use of more sustainable transport modes, such as cycling, shared mobility, and public transport.}

Existent income inequality is part of what drives this interest.

In addition, the few existing studies only focus on post-tax income distribution. This paper provides the first known analysis that includes both pre-tax and post-tax income distribution, and a specific focus on the richest one percent. Random effects regressions and instrumental variables are used to analyse panel data covering 14 OECD countries during the 1992–2016 period. Inequality has an effect on overall household transport expenditure, and more specifically on purchase of vehicles and operation of private transport equipment. The pre-tax share of the rich increases overall expenditure on purchases of new private vehicles, with a decreasing effect when market inequality is high. The post-tax share of the poor has an effect on operation of transport equipment, but the sign of this effect depends on the existent level of post-tax inequality.}

However, given the fact that BEV are a relatively new product category, and the majority of car users have little experience of using BEV, consumers often have a misconception about BEV, and thus tend to avoid purchasing an electric vehicle. This paper aims to explore the role of customer experience and demonstrate how this experience affects the adoption willingness of BEV. Based on driving experience and the theory of planned behavior, the authors constructed a framework of influencing factors for electric vehicle adoption willingness with the incorporation of consumer experience as the antecedents of adoption willingness. Using sample data from Jiangsu province, China, our empirical analysis shows that the mean values of the subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and adoption willingness of experienced consumers are significantly higher than those of inexperienced consumers. Further, the adoption willingness is positively influenced by experience through direct and indirect paths, which confirms the significant mediating effects of subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and attitudes (battery life, cruising range, low noise, and low emission).},

Our work utilises open datasets and presents a generic multicriteria-based modelling framework for EIA framework. The E-CP Infrastructure Framework a two-stage framework. The first stage assesses the existing infrastructure gap and spatial disparity of E-CP allocation at the city scale. Next, guided by the information from stage one, stage two identifies the optimal E-CP candidate locations for future EIA expansion. The locations are determined using a parametric scoring approach that includes ease of access, available bays for parked vehicles, and potential congestion risk. We take the example of Dresden city to demonstrate the applicability of the EIA framework. Our findings show the wide prevalence of spatial disparities in E-CPs across nine of the ten wards in the city. Our proposed city-scale approach for identifying candidate locations could help policymakers decide on the augmentation strategies of E-CP infrastructure in a spatially equitable and cost-effective manner.}

However, the lack of EV charging infrastructure with their inequitable distribution is still the most severe obstacle to widespread EV uptake while the charging infrastructure continues to expand across the US. This paper proposes a novel data-driven placement and sizing of charging stations in San Francisco, by quantifying social equity access, EV charging demand coverage, and site development costs including construction, operating, and installation costs. To this end, first 200 possible EV charging stations, as an initial generation, are located in San Francisco. Then, the optimal size, charging type, and locations of charging stations are adjusted/identified resulting from the trade-off between minimized site development cost, maximized social equity access, and EV charge demand fulfillment. The placement, charging type, and sizing of EV charging stations are formulated as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and solved by the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Ultimately, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to obtain the optimal solution from the Pareto-optimal front. According to the balance between minimizing site development costs, maximizing EV demand coverage, and ensuring the highest level of social equity access, energy service providers and charging station owners can strategically decide to place charging stations in San Francisco's middle, west, and northwest regions.}

Current EV charging station (EVCS) distribution favors affluent areas, potentially reinforcing inequalities. We address this using a spatially-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) model that learns urban dynamics and socio-economic factors for equitable EVCS placement. Our methodology analyzes charging patterns across residential, working/industrial, and commercial zones by integrating EVCS utilization, traffic patterns, urban structure, parking availability, and deprivation indices. Our analysis revealed EVCS infrastructure concentration in commercial zones, with less deployment in working/industrial areas and significant gaps in residential zones. Glasgow showed higher utilization rates, particularly in residential areas, while Edinburgh demonstrated utilization disparities in residential zones, with deprived areas showing lower usage despite need. To solve this issue, GNN-leveraged recommendations were utilized for strategic charger deployment in underserved areas. The findings indicate that in residential areas, 22 kW chargers show substantial benefit to underserved communities, with higher output chargers becoming more effective only beyond 50 initial installations. Working areas show similar patterns, while commercial areas demonstrate lower improvement across all charger types, confirming infrastructure saturation. These findings provide policymakers a framework to prioritize EVCS deployment for reducing disparities and accelerating EV adoption. Overall, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in identifying potential locations for EVCS deployment, particularly in underserved communities.}

Exploring the socioeconomic and demographic correlates of charging station spatial disparity, it is discerned that (i) areas with a higher share of racial minorities are less likely to have access to charging stations; (ii) affluent areas are more likely to have access to a charging station; and (iii) there is an inverse relationship between age and access to EV charging stations. Exploring the built environment correlates of charging station spatial disparity, it is noticed that (i) the West region of America is disproportionately home to better access to charging stations and has a higher charging station density; (ii) the presence of charging stations is less likely in census tracts with a higher population density; (iii) areas historically underinvested in, with energy burdens, and with transit barriers are less likely to have a charging station; and (iv) red states have a lower chance of charging station presence compared to blue states.

The framework helps characterize the varied impacts across socio-demographic groups, including on low-income and marginalized communities. We explore how the direct and indirect effects of accessibility and user experience might influence the distribution and design of EV charging stations. Considerations of socio-economic diversity in the deployment of charging infrastructure are critical to ensure equitable benefits from electric mobility.

Equal-per-household redistribution of the carbon revenue could reverse the regressive effect into a progressive effect. However, there is substantial variation within the different economic status groups leaving notable shares of households with a very low economic status without a positive net transfer. This share will be lowest in the metropolises of the urban region and highest in small-sized cities/village areas of the urban and rural region. Particularly in the latter area categories, these households may need temporary mobility allowances due to limited abatement options.

This work examines the total costs of ownership of mode shifting and car sharing in transport and investment needs for domestic retrofit for energy poverty alleviation. The analysis finds that eBikes for suitable commutes bring substantial economic and environmental benefits compared to cars. For car sharing, the economic and environmental benefits are also substantial, with electric vehicles becoming cost effective at all occupancy rates from 2025. Regarding the alleviation of energy poverty, the mean cost to retrofit energy poor dwellings ranges from £2,143 depending on dwelling type. However, up to 3.5% of residents of each dwelling type will find the consequent debt burden causes significant financial stress, particularly for the elderly and those claiming benefits. This study concludes that the current mechanisms to support energy and transport poverty alleviation are insufficient and too narrowly targeted. Their expansion is a requisite component of any hopes of achieving a Just Transition in Northern Ireland.}

Therefore, we assess the social costs of a decarbonized ground-based passenger transport system in 2040, covering vehicle costs, costs for externalities and travel time costs across travel modes. Our results show that social costs decline with the introduction of decarbonization strategies. Specific effects include a reduction of vehicle costs and external costs, a rise in external benefits due to positive health effects of active mobility that overcompensate remaining external costs, and possibly increased travel time costs.}

abstract = {Based on a large-scale public survey, we identify and quantify the significance of key factors associated with the deployment of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. Our results indicate that individual characteristics, such as income, age, region, and single vs. multi-family housing type can significantly affect electric vehicle purchase preferences, especially those concerning overnight charging and perceptions of benefits and barriers. Moreover, our results challenge earlier findings in the literature by showing how certain elements, such as expected electric driving range, certain travel behaviors (e.g., driving distance, destination types), the most common perceived benefits (e.g., cleaner air) or barriers (e.g., reliability concerns), and preferred location for public charging seem to not vary much or at all with the socioeconomic, demographic, and geographical variables examined in this study. We conclude with the implications for policies to advance equitable vehicle electrification. Our findings underscore the importance of lower-cost models of electric vehicles, home and public charging access, charging infrastructure planning, more integrated analysis of interlinked housing and transportation needs and solutions, the availability of alternative transportation modes, and the potential role of gas stations for electric vehicles. We encourage others to build on these results and have shared our complete survey instrument as an added contribution.}

With increasing number of electric vehicles, attention to controlled charging as a means to provide flexibility to the electricity system with high shares of renewable generation is rising. This study explores the implications of spatially shifting electric vehicle charging load with the focus on home vs. workplace charging in Switzerland in 2035. The study applies a spatially-explicit electricity system optimization model EXPANSE with a resolution of 2′169 Swiss municipalities, combines it with a vehicle commuting matrix, and optimizes the charging of electric vehicles used for commuting purposes between the municipalities of home and workplace. The results show that workplace charging can reduce the need for electricity import and storage and promote solar photovoltaic integration unless the shares of renewable generation are already high, hence benefiting the whole system. The optimal share of workplace charging is over 90\% from the electricity system's perspective if all private vehicles in Switzerland are electric vehicles. Workplace charging is systematically preferred in northern and western Switzerland. This study highlights the potential of spatially-optimized electric vehicle charging to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of the electricity system for the broader goal of decarbonizing both the transport and electricity sectors.}

The paper is based on a comparative analysis of case studies. The main lock-in mechanisms analysed are learning effects, economies of scale, economies of scope, network externalities, informational increasing returns, technological interrelatedness, collective action, institutional learning effects and the differentiation of power. We show that very different path dependencies have been reinforced by the lock-in mechanisms. Hence, the characteristics of existing regimes set the preconditions for the development of new transition pathways. The incumbent socio-technical regime is not just fossil-based, but may also include mature niches specialised in the exploitation of renewable sources. This implies a need to distinguish between lock-in mechanisms favouring the old fossil-based regime, well-established (mature) renewable energy niches, or new pathways.}

Some of these stations are placed at the destinations of drivers rather than along the route of their trip. The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of user behavior in the context of public destination charging and to provide an extension for existing evaluation methods. We identify losses in demand and potential revenue and show how they are influenced by user behavior. Different scenarios are analyzed to demonstrate the effect of single parameters and to quantify their impact on revenue. To demonstrate the interaction between parameters we present a case study on supermarkets in a medium sized German city. The results show that user behavior is an important factor for the economic evaluation of public destination charging stations and therefore needs to be considered in future evaluation methods. In addition, we show that charging station operators have the possibility to counteract losses by providing more charging stations or increasing the charging power.}

However, electric vehicles (EVs) comprise less than 1.2% of New Zealand’s light vehicle fleet, and there are significant hurdles to limit EV uptake. This study uses spatial negative binomial regression models to estimate spatio-temporal factors that influence consumers’ purchase decisions. Two hypotheses are tested: (1) if charging infrastructure has a “neighbourhood effect” on EV uptake; (2) if EVs adoption by technology enthusiasts during the early-adopter phase affects subsequent adoption once the technology becomes widely spread. Results show that charging infrastructure in neighbouring areas and early adoption positively affect subsequent technology adoption. Robustness analysis suggests that the distance spatial weights matrices outperformed other types of alternatives in this study may represent the boundaries of a convenience threshold that drivers perceive when they get their EVs. Thus, policy initiatives aiming to increase the electrification of transport should consider the likelihood of early adoption and the spatial proximity of charging infrastructure.}

Analyzing how physical space relates to transportation becomes vital to assessing transportation systems and planning improvements. Such an assessment can be performed by evaluating the efficiency of the network through different metrics. Within these, circuity measures the ratio between the road network and straight-line distances. This work analyzes and compares circuity for walking, cycling, and driving networks across 41 European cities. Concurrently, we identify cities' mobility cultures (socio-cultural constructs related to mobility) to identify differences between cities' circuities and mobility patterns. Data-driven methods were employed to cluster cities into six groups according to their mobility culture: Cycling Champion Cities, Sustainable Transportation Advocates, Multimodal Metropolises, Car Dependent Cities, Walking Conducive Cities, and Pro Transit Cities. Both intra- and inter-city differences were discovered for average circuity levels, and statistical differences were found between different clusters' circuity values. Car Dependent Cities had the worst circuity levels across the three transport modes; Sustainable Transport Advocates had the lowest circuity overall; and Cycling Champions Cities exhibited low levels of circuity for cycling and walking but high for driving. Results show how circuity varies between European cities and their mobility cultures, drawing attention to how different types of urban street networks are correlated to cities' mobility constructs. Further, this work poses a benchmark for cities, e.g., cities aspiring to be Sustainable Transportation Advocates can use such an approach to understand how such cities' networks are constructed and how urban structure is related to network efficiency.}

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are used widely to analyze energy system transitions over a decadal time frame to help inform and evaluating international climate policy. As part of this, IAMs also explore pathways of decarbonizing the transport sector. This study quantifies the contribution of changes in activity growth, modal structure, energy intensity and fuel mix to the projected passenger transport carbon emission pathways. The Laspeyres index decomposition method is used to compare results across models and scenarios, and against historical transport trends. Broadly-speaking the models show similar trends, projecting continuous transport activity growth, reduced energy intensity and in some cases modal shift to carbon-intensive modes - similar to those observed historically in a business-as-usual scenario. In policy-induced mitigation scenarios further enhancements of energy efficiency and fuel switching is seen, showing a clear break with historical trends. Reduced activity growth and modal shift (towards less carbon-intensive modes) only have a limited contribution to emission reduction. Measures that could induce such changes could possibly complement the aggressive, technology switch required in the current scenarios to reach internationally agreed climate targets.}

In addition to the customary coverage of in-vehicle time in review studies, this paper covers valuations of walk time, wait time, service headway, parking space search time, departure time switching, time in congested traffic, schedule delay early and late, mean lateness and the standard deviation of travel time. Valuations are found to vary with type of time, GDP, distance, journey purpose, mode, the monetary numeraire and a number of factors related to estimation. Model output values of time compare favourably with earnings data, replicate well official recommended values obtained from major national studies, and are transferable across countries. These implied monetary values serve as very useful benchmarks against which new evidence can be assessed and the meta-model provides parameters and values for countries and contexts where there is no other such evidence.}

ABSTRACT = {Distance is one of the important factors in determining transportation cost and travel time, and it can be easily estimated by measuring the circuity of road networks. This study calculated the circuity factors to estimate the network distance for 27 forest roads (about 105 km) in South Korea. For this purpose, ridge, mid-slope, and valley roads were classified according to the construction location of the mountain slope, and the weighted and unweighted circuity factor (each 500-m section) were calculated. The average value of weighted circuity was 1.55: mid-slope roads (2.09), ridge roads (1.36), and valley roads (1.09). The average unweighted circuity factors were 1.61 for mid-slope roads, 1.21 for ridge roads, and 1.07 for valley roads. This study found that the circuity of the forest road network was most affected by the mountain terrain. In addition, the circuity factor increased with increasing network distance in the mid-slope roads but was not affected by the network distance in ridges and valleys. To improve the efficiency of transportation in the forest road network, it is important to locate the ladings and properly connect with the public road network.},

Using data from an enhanced version of the Department for Transport ‘MOT’ vehicle test record database, combined with data on domestic gas and electricity consumption from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (formerly the Department of Energy and Climate Change), patterns of car usage and consequent energy consumption are investigated, and the costs of Vehicle Excise Duty and road fuel examined as a proportion of total expenditure on household direct energy consumption. Through the use of these new datasets it is possible to analyse how these vary spatially and in relation to levels of median income. The findings indicate that motoring costs are strongly regressive, with lower income areas, especially in rural locations, spending around twice as much of their income on motoring costs as the highest income areas.}

Specifically, we conduct comprehensive comparisons of opportunity-centric accessibility measures with distance-based measures and perform counterfactual analyses under various PCS deployment strategies. Our findings reveal significant inequalities in PCS access across different neighborhoods under distance-based and opportunity-centric measures. However, a greater disparity exists when considering opportunities, with high-income communities having significantly better access to PCSs. Counterfactual analyses suggest that equitable deployment based on distance measures results in the least equitable outcomes when considering opportunities, primarily due to the existing disparity in opportunity distributions in our cities. Our insights highlight the complexity of locating PCSs and can guide nationwide PCS deployment for long-term societal benefits.}

We allow the effect of road infrastructures to depend on the extent of the road use by provincial industries, proxied by these industries’ vehicle intensity. Moreover, we consider the services provided by the stock of road infrastructures as an impure public good, that is, one that is subject to congestion. Finally, using the instrumental variables technique, we account for possible problems of endogeneity in the regressions.

Estudiamos la inversión pública en infraestructura de carreteras como un determinante del crecimiento de la productividad factorial total (TFP) para provincias españolas (NUTS 3) durante el período 1984–1994. Permitimos que el efecto de infraestructura de carreteras dependa de la escala de utilización de las carreteras por industrias provinciales, representada mediante la intensidad de vehículos de estas industrias. Además, consideramos los servicios aportados por el conjunto de infraestructura de carreteras como un bien público impuro, es decir, uno sujeto a congestión.

abstract = {Lack of cross-border transport supply has repeatedly been blamed for the fact that national borders limit spatial interaction and, consequently, the growth of border regions. This study applies an accessibility approach to investigate for most municipalities in ten countries in mainland West Europe if foreign transport supply is lagging behind, and if population growth in these municipalities has been affected by the limits that national borders have imposed on market access. To do so, data describing historical population changes and road networks between 1961 and 2011 have been used. The results show that in the study area, cross-border transport accessibility was not at a disadvantage in 1961 and has since then grown even more than domestic accessibility. However, municipal population growth has depended almost exclusively on domestic market access. Processes of economic international integration in the study area are found to coincide with the growth of cross-border accessibility, but do not have a clear coincidence with the effects of cross-border accessibility on population growth.}

abstract = {This study examines carbon emissions from European land transportation, considering spatial autocorrelation patterns. Using global and local Moran's I indices, we find evidence of positive spatial autocorrelation in the panel data of 26 European countries from 1995 to 2019. To adequately analyze the factors influencing transport emissions, we then employ the spatial Durbin model and integrate transport-specific regression models, extending the classic STIRPAT model. The regression models include parameters such as transport intensities, modal splits between road and rail, and infrastructure density. Understanding spatial patterns in transport emissions provides valuable insights for policymakers in developing more effective emissions reduction strategies. Our results emphasize the importance of close European cooperation due to significant spatial dependencies, urging reductions in transport intensities and a shift from road to rail services. Additionally, we identify a non-linear relationship between infrastructure development and carbon emissions, suggesting the existence of 'sustainability sweet spots' in future infrastructure planning.}

abstract = {The success of electric vehicle (EV) adoption greatly depends on spatial deployment of charging infrastructure. However, existing literature often overlooks the spatial cross-side network effect (SCNE) of infrastructure on EV adoption. Using the quarterly panel data of Tesla in the United States (US), this study reveals that EV adoption in one state would increase by 5.75\% and 1.09\% if the charging accessibility increases by 1\% in this state and its neighboring states respectively. Furthermore, such effect is heterogeneous between Tesla’s superchargers (SC) and destination charging (DC) stations, in that only accessibility to SC stations can significantly drive vehicle adoption across neighboring states. Moreover, the SCNE of DC stations on vehicle adoption can be amplified if the neighboring states are positioned more centrally in the US interstate highway network. We offer managerial and policy implications for businesses and governments to promote the adoption of EVs by developing the spatially deployed infrastructure.}

The findings demonstrate a large variance of charging costs across countries and charging options, suggesting different policy options to reduce charging costs.

abstract = {Electric vehicles are a necessary part of a zero-carbon future. However, one in five motorists worldwide depend on small petrol motorcycles for their transport needs — vehicles for which no satisfactory low-carbon substitute exists. Meanwhile, the rise in electric car ownership is not reducing GHG emissions as much as often thought, due to the significant emissions from producing ever-larger batteries. Both problems can be solved by uncovering the mechanisms of long distance EV travel, beyond battery range, where the interaction with recharging infrastructure governs vehicle performance. This study develops a new model for journeys involving multiple run-recharge cycles and introduces a novel metric for EV performance — Day Range. Not only does this allow a direct comparison between a wide variety of vehicle and infrastructure options but, by further manipulating the formulae, high level trends can be observed and specific quantitative guidelines extracted. In vehicle design, a strong emphasis on efficiency and recharge rates can drastically reduce both in-use and embodied energy while matching the touring performance of a conventional, resource intensive, heavy battery car. Meanwhile, the recharging network can be developed to better support this lower energy use. Taking the example of the UK motorway network, charge rates up to only 100kW should be installed with the focus instead falling on reliably reducing chargepoint intervals at least as far as the existing target of 28 miles, and ideally much further. In doing so, required battery capacity can be reduced from the 60kWh+ currently seen as necessary to as little as 25kWh. The resulting vehicles not only consume less energy in motion but emit far less greenhouse gases during manufacture and will cost less to produce, allowing a much wider uptake of electric vehicles than possible under the existing, energy intensive battery vehicle touring paradigm.}

abstract = {The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for urban sustainability, which can promote the low carbon transition of urban mobility systems and increase energy independence. However, inadequate access to charging infrastructure has posed significant challenges on penetration to the mass market, which requires an equitable distribution of public charging facilities among residents. Current planning and deployment of public charging facilities only take efficiency into account, with limited attention to the spatial equity in distribution. Hence, this study proposes a spatial statistical approach to evaluate whether electric vehicle charging services (EVCS) are equitably distributed. An innovative accessibility measurement model is first developed for EVCS, considering competition over changing demand and different charging capacities. On this basis, a spatial autocorrelation analysis procedure is further designed to investigate spatial patterns of residential accessibility and detect regional disparities. The proposed methodology is tested with the top ten cities in China by their capacity of EVCS, where most cities exhibit significant inequitable distribution but with different regional characteristics. It is demonstrated that the methodology can improve the accuracy of measurement while remaining easy to implement. Therefore, it can serve as a policy tool for EVCS planning to maximize its capability to facilitate EV uptake.}

Electric vehicles represent a key technology in the mitigation of transportation greenhouse gas emissions and ambitious EV adoption targets have been set by many governments by 2030 and beyond. The rollout of EV charging infrastructure is vital in achieving this goal, as the uptake of EVs is linked to the level of coverage of EV chargers. To date, both the public and private sectors have been involved in the provision of charging stations and it is timely to consider the roles of the different actors in this market. We consider whether EV charging infrastructure is a public good or private asset and address the issues of the location of future chargers, the deployment models needed to develop, operate and own charging infrastructure, and finally the policy context for the development of charging infrastructure. We find that clear roles should be assigned to the individual public and private actors and funders, in order to achieve efficient development of the required infrastructure for large-scale EV deployment.}

Despite increased electric vehicle infrastructure roll out rates, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the charging market. For example, studies have evidenced disparities in electric vehicle charging placement, however, predictable as the market caters for early adopters. While there is an emerging discourse surrounding social equity in charging infrastructure, this is scattered across interdisciplinary research covering broader aspects of electric vehicle infrastructure provision with a lack of studies consolidating issues. This study aims to synthesize evidence on social equity in various aspects of electric vehicle charging infrastructure provision and set an agenda for centering social equity in the debate. Findings of this critical synthesis of research have helped to draw out the complexities involved in the equitable roll out of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which are interlinked with an array of other dimensions including the affordability of electric vehicle purchase. Research into solutions and best practice has shown examples of local target setting, monetary incentives (grants, loans and rebates for electric vehicle purchase and charging infrastructure and smart energy tariffs) and other policy incentives (increased public overnight charging, electric car-clubs, extended battery warranties for second-hand vehicles) that can or have been employed to redress the balance. The outcomes could be utilized when developing and implementing electric vehicle strategies to support uptake across all people. Policy implications and further study suggested could ensure that communities and individuals are not locked out of the benefits of investment.}

There is uncertainty about which charging deployment tactic to follow. The main issue is how many of charging stations, of which type, should be installed and where. Early roll-out has been successful in many places, but knowledge on how to plan a large-scale charging network in urban areas is missing. Little is known about return to scale effects, reciprocal effects of charger availability on sales, and the impact of fast charging or more clustered charging hubs on charging preferences of EV owners. This paper explores the effects of various roll-out strategies for charging infrastructure that facilitate the large-scale introduction of EVs, using agent-based simulation. In contrast to previously proposed models, our model is rooted in empirically observed charging patterns from EVs instead of travel patterns of fossil fuelled cars. In addition, the simulation incorporates different user types (inhabitants, visitors, taxis and shared vehicles) to model the diversity of charging behaviours in an urban environment. Different scenarios are explored along the lines of the type of charging infrastructure (level 2, clustered level 2, fast charging) and the intensity of rollout (EV to charging point ratio). The simulation predicts both the success rate of charging attempts and the additional discomfort when searching for a charging station. Results suggest that return to scale and reciprocal effects in charging infrastructure are considerable, resulting in a lower EV to charging station ratio on the longer term.}

Although EVs (electric vehicles) are considered to contribute to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution caused by passenger car transport, their use is still very modest. The core objective of this paper is to identify the major impact factors for the broader dissemination of EVs in urban areas. We compare and analyse cities selected in nine different countries which are active in dissemination of EVs. The most important recommendation for policy makers is that all monetary and non-monetary promotion measures implemented should depend on the environmental benignity of the electricity generation mix. From society's point of view the promotion of EVs make sense only if it is ensured that a major share of electricity they use is generated from renewables. Since the final goal is not just to increase the number of EVs but to reduce emissions, cities also have to consider other e-mobility options such as trolleybuses, metros, trams and electro buses, as well as promote walking and biking, especially for short distances.}

Existing studies on net-zero scenarios using Energy System Optimization Models (ESOM) often overlook non-monetary aspects of consumers' mobility choices but primarily focus on cost aspects. This study incorporates consumers' travel time duration and valuation, and an endogenous modal shift option into the Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM). STEM is applied in a multi-objective optimization framework to quantify the impacts of faster Public Transport (PT) and slower car speeds on modal shifts in the transport sector's transformation. Similarly, we assess scenarios where consumers weigh travel time less, reflecting improved travel productivity. The results show that speed variations on medium- and long-distance trips, which can be interpreted as policies for highway speed limits and more efficient PT, can induce modal shifts towards 5–10% higher PT demand. Its implied secondary effects across the energy system include a reduced need for electrification of heavy-duty trucks by 11% and a decrease in hydrogen demand in road transportation by 34% by 2050. If travelers weigh costs over travel time, PT becomes less competitive against cars. Thus, electric vehicles (EVs) need to play a more dominant role in decarbonization, with a demand increase of 13% in 2040 (+9.2 billion passenger kilometer (bpkm)) and 6% in 2050 (+5.0 bpkm), along with the need for additional 45,000 public chargers of 22 kW size. Policy implications include the emphasis on improved PT speeds, speed limits on highways, needs to achieve more widespread EV adoption, and the need for balancing travelers' decision factors when aiming for reduced transport CO2 emissions.}

Many of the existing reviews identify a list of challenges common to most models, but they tend to be grouped according to type or energy carrier. Here we take a new approach and structure both well-established models and solution approaches along with the main challenges that energy modelling will have to deal with in the near future. We focus on four main current challenges that energy system models face: time and space; uncertainty; multi-energy; energy behaviour and energy transition. The main findings suggest that: demand-side management applied to multi-carrier energy system models lacks; prosumers is explored only in a limited manner; general, multi-scale modelling frameworks should be established and considered both in the dimensions of time, space, technology and energy carrier; long term energy system models tend to address uncertainty scarcely; there is a lack of studies modelling uncertainties related to emerging technologies and; modelling of energy consumer behaviour is one of the major aspect of future research.}

These challenges require an accurate characterization of EV user charging behavior, especially with evolving battery technology. This study critically reviews approaches and data sources used to elicit EV charging behavior and patterns from a demand-side perspective and investigates how supply-side studies on charging infrastructure deployment and management incorporate charging behavior. We observe a noticeable disconnect between both strands of the literature, as supply-side studies still rely on simplistic assumptions about charging behavior and focus on a handful of aspects in isolation. More specifically, several studies either consider personal EVs or ride-hailing services with only public fast-charging infrastructure while ignoring available home/work charging infrastructure. We recommend shifting from this silo approach to a system-level dynamic planning framework where future charging demand is forecasted by combining charging behavior models with the models to forecast travel demand and EV adoption, followed by an integration of demand information into supply-side optimization. The framework can thus capture complex supply–demand interactions and inform the charging infrastructure planning policies, laying out a roadmap for emerging and mature EV markets.}

In this paper, we develop a system dynamics model to study the feedback mechanism between the fueling infrastructure funding policies and the medium- to long-term diffusion of FCEVs and BEVs, and the competition between FCEVs and BEVs based on relevant policy and market data in Guangzhou, China. The results of the modeling analysis are as follows. (1) Funding hydrogen refueling stations and public charging piles has positive implications for achieving the substitution of CEVs for ICEVs. (2) Adjusting the funding ratio of hydrogen refueling stations and public charging piles or increasing the funding budget and extending the funding cycle does not have a significant impact on the overall substitution of CEVs for ICEVs but only impacts the relative competitive advantage between FCEVs and BEVs. (3) An equal share of funding for hydrogen refueling stations and public charging piles would have better strategic value for future net-zero-emissions urban transportation. (4) Making a moderate-level full investment in hydrogen refueling stations, coupled with hydrogen refueling subsidies, can provide the ideal conditions for FCEV diffusion.}

Increased BEV adoption makes the realistic assessment of charging infrastructure demand critical. The current literature on charging infrastructure often uses outdated charging behavior assumptions such as universal access to home chargers and the “Liquid-fuel” mental model. We simulate charging infrastructure needs using a large-scale agent-based simulation of Sweden with detailed individual characteristics, including dwelling types and activity patterns. The two state-of-art archetypes of charging behaviors, “Plan-ahead” and “Event-triggered”, mirror the current infrastructure built-up, suggesting 2.3–4.5 times more public chargers per BEV than the “Liquid-fuel” mental model. We also estimate roughly 30–150 BEVs served by a slow charger may be needed for non-home residential overnight charging.}

abstract = {While the transportation sector is responsible for a growing share of greenhouse gas emissions, electric vehicles (EVs) offer solutions for greener mobility. The proportion of electric vehicles in transportation fleets is increasing, but wider adoption will not be possible without an appropriate charging infrastructure. The deployment of such infrastructure should follow a strategy that considers both the environment in which it is deployed and the behavior patterns of electric vehicle users. If these aspects are not taken into consideration, there is a risk of failing to meet users’ needs and generating additional costs. Here we review the literature on location problems for electric vehicle charging stations. We aim to draw up a comparative overview of approaches that have been used up to 2020 for optimizing the locations of charging infrastructure. We first briefly review the issues raised by the deployment of charging infrastructure, namely technical, economic and user acceptance concerns. We then look at the goals of the infrastructure location models in the literature. Schematically, those goals fall into two categories: minimizing the cost of charging infrastructure for a given level of service, or maximizing the service provided for a given cost. Finally, we focus on the approaches used to achieve these goals. Three categories of approaches are identified: node, path, and tour- or activity-based approaches. We then discuss these approaches in relation to technical, economic and user acceptance factors in order to provide a comprehensive analysis for stakeholders involved in EV charging infrastructure planning. Directions are given for future research to develop models that better reflect the real-world picture.}

The initial search resulted in 1,690 publications, but after a thorough exclusion process, 537 articles were deemed relevant and were sorted by source, publication year, country of origin, data collection method, and research domain. The results revealed the influential factors over individuals’ desire to adopt an EV were categorized into four main types (contextual, situational, demographic, and psychological); situational factors, that can act as both barriers and motivators, had the most influencing components. The most cited barriers to adoption of EVs were found to be the lack of charging stations availability and their limited driving range. The most cited motivators to EV adoption were found to be reduction in air pollution and the availability of policy incentives. The findings of this study may guide policymakers in formulating effective transportation and energy policies, as well as provide guidance to those who are responsible for designing EVs that fit the needs and demands of potential consumers.}

It finds that environmental and energy security pressures have created a favourable landscape ‘push’ for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) that in turn has encouraged and facilitated serious commitment from some manufacturers. Yet BEVs, as a niche product seeking to disrupt an entrenched and established regime, face significant multi-level forces acting as barriers against such a transition, which the paper explores. This combination of factors creates a situation where BEV market penetration remains far below the level required for mass market transition. For BEVs to ‘cross the chasm’ and gain an established foothold in the market and hence significantly disrupt the regime, more holistic and effective solutions are required. It is argued that, so far, this has yet to be fully taken on board by policy makers.}

MoCho-TIMES addresses the scarce ability of E4 models to realistically depict behaviour in transport and allows for modal shift towards transit and non-motorized modes as a new dimension for decarbonising the transportation sector. The novel methodology determines endogenous modal shares by incorporating variables related to the level-of-service (LoS) of modes and consumers’ modal perception within the E4 modeling framework. Heterogeneity of transport users is introduced to differentiate modal perception and preferences across different consumer groups, while modal preferences are quantified via monetization of intangible costs. A support transport simulation model consistent with the geographical scope of the E4 model provides the data and mathematical expressions required to develop the approach. This study develops MoCho-TIMES in the standalone transportation sector of TIMES-DK, the integrated energy system model for Denmark. The model is tested for the Business as Usual scenario and for four alternative scenarios that imply diverse assumptions for the new attributes introduced. The results show that different assumptions for the new attributes affect modal shares and CO2 emissions. MoCho-TIMES inaugurates the possibility to perform innovative policy analyses involving new parameters to the E4 modeling framework. The results find that authority’s commitment to sustainability is crucial for a paradigmatic change in the transportation sector.}

It addresses three questions: (1) How is the electric vehicle charging infrastructure currently distributed across the United States? (2) How accessible and affordable are electric vehicles to the general public? (3) How equitably are electric vehicle rebates allocated? This inquiry is driven by projections that the U.S. will need 28 million private and 1.2 million public chargers by 2030 to support the expanding electric vehicle market. Three findings are of particular importance. First, geographic and socioeconomic disparities characterize the distribution of electric vehicle charging stations. Lower-income areas and communities predominantly inhabited by racial minorities have markedly less access to charging infrastructure compared to white-majority areas. Second, the economic burden of installing home chargers is not feasible for many living in multi-family housing or renting, which exacerbates the existing inequities in electric vehicle adoption. Third, the imbalance in rebate distribution not only perpetuates the socioeconomic disparities but also contradicts the goals set by justice initiatives that aim to ensure 40 % of benefits from federal investments target historically underserved communities. The findings underscore the need for targeted policy interventions that prioritize the expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure into underserved areas. Implementing a comprehensive approach to infrastructure planning and incentive allocation is crucial for promoting environmental sustainability and achieving the broader United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This supports a fair transition toward widespread electric vehicle adoption.}

A gravity model was used to measure the accessibility of stations in each tract while considering the competition among tracts for charging infrastructure. Unlike prior studies, we evaluate current distribution from various equity viewpoints, clearly defining these perspectives and investigating their implications for charging distribution. The findings revealed significantly higher accessibility of public stations in areas with a lower share of single-family homes, a higher share of commercial areas, and proximity to major roadways, irrespective of population and EV adoption rates. Moreover, we found that the current distribution is consistent with utilitarian and capabilities-based theories of equity. Spatial tools such as Moran's I and spatial regression were used to analyze the spatial disparity of the proposed accessibility measure, showing the existence of a highly clustered spatial distribution. This study offers valuable insights into integrating equity considerations in assessing accessibility to transportation facilities, especially EV charging stations. Such an approach can facilitate the promotion of EV adoption across diverse groups, a critical factor in achieving sustainable city development goals by mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing mobility.}

Exploring the socioeconomic and demographic correlates of charging station spatial disparity, it is discerned that (i) areas with a higher share of racial minorities are less likely to have access to charging stations; (ii) affluent areas are more likely to have access to a charging station; and (iii) there is an inverse relationship between age and access to EV charging stations. Exploring the built environment correlates of charging station spatial disparity, it is noticed that (i) the West region of America is disproportionately home to better access to charging stations and has a higher charging station density; (ii) the presence of charging stations is less likely in census tracts with a higher population density; (iii) areas historically underinvested in, with energy burdens, and with transit barriers are less likely to have a charging station; and (iv) red states have a lower chance of charging station presence compared to blue states. The findings highlight the need to address disparities, but the choice to take action remains a policy decision on every level that requires the cooperation of federal, state, and local agencies.}

Governments, automotive manufacturers, and charging infrastructure operators have deployed market-boosting initiatives to incentivize purchase. Yet, their market diffusion is limited by several barriers. To shed light on the main barriers, and based on an extensive state-of-the-art, we used an original database and statistically analyzed the relationship of 21 socio-demographic, technical, and economic factors on BEV and PHEV market shares, separately, in 94 French departments from 2015 to 2019, using mixed-effect regression. We find different covariates related to BEV and PHEV sales, respectively, suggesting the two markets respond to different incentives. The number of available BEV/PHEV models and energy prices are positively correlated with BEV and PHEV adoption. Fast, ultrafast charger density and local incentives positively relate with BEV sales, while slow-and-normal charger density to PHEV sales. Contrarily, national subsidies, relative to vehicles’ prices, are negatively correlated with PHEVs sales and is open for further studies. Based on the results, policy recommendations are considered for the automotive industry, charging operators, and local authorities to draw a roadmap for electric mobility transition in France.}

To address this gap, we propose an integrated approach utilizing a discrete choice model and a Bayesian network-generated synthetic population. Applied to Maryland, the model analyzes the impact of public charging stations (level-2 and DC fast chargers) on EV ownership at the census tract level. Access to fast charging, workplace charging, and the possibility of teleworking are key factors influencing EV ownership. The model, applied to the synthetic population, predicts higher EV growth in suburban regions compared to urban areas and a larger increase in EV adoption among high-income groups. This highlights potential disparities in EV adoption and demonstrates the application of this methodology in understanding micro-level EV adoption rates for informing targeted policies and infrastructure development to promote equitable adoption.}

    abstract = { All types of consumer expenditures ultimately vie for the same pool of limited resources—the consumer's discretionary income. Consequently, consumers’ spending in a particular industry can be better understood in relation to their expenditures in others. Although marketers may believe that they are operating in distinct and unrelated industries, it is important to understand how consumers, with a given budget, make trade-offs between meeting different consumption needs. For example, how much would escalating gas prices affect consumer spending on food and apparel? Which industries would gain most in terms of extra consumer spending as a result of a tax rebate? Answers to these questions are also important from a public policy standpoint because they provide insights into how consumer welfare would be affected as consumers reallocate their consumption budget in response to environmental changes. This study proposes a structural demand model to approximate the household budget allocation decision, in which consumers are assumed to allocate a given budget across a full spectrum of consumption categories to maximize an underlying utility function. The authors illustrate the model using Consumer Expenditure Survey data from the United States, covering 31 consumption categories over 22 years. The calibrated model makes it possible to draw direct inferences about the trade-offs individual households make when they face budget constraints and how their relative preferences for different consumption categories vary across life stages and income levels. The study also demonstrates how the proposed model can be used in policy simulations to quantify the potential impacts on consumption patterns due to shifts in prices or discretionary income. }

Highlights of our present assessment, include a detailed, component-based manufacturing and operating cost analysis, as well as simulation-based component scaling and fuel consumption analysis. We apply this methodology to eight passenger car concepts based on batteries, fuel cells and combustion engines, spanning four passenger car segments and five different market development scenarios through 2050. With respect to the TCO, our analysis reveals that fully-electric powertrains utilizing batteries (BEVs) and fuel cells (FCEVs) offer the lowest-cost solutions. FCEVs exhibit small but robust benefits compared to BEVs. BEVs will undergo the earliest break-even point with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), already before 2030. Different market development scenarios would not significantly affect the long-term results.}
