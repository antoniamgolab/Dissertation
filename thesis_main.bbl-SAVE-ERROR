      \field{abstract}{In this study, we utilize data from over 28,000 public charging stations (PCSs) and 5.5 million points of interest across twenty U.S. metropolitan areas to underscore the importance of considering the availability of daily activity opportunities when assessing accessibility to PCSs, rather than relying solely on spatial proximity. Specifically, we conduct comprehensive comparisons of opportunity-centric accessibility measures with distance-based measures and perform counterfactual analyses under various PCS deployment strategies. Our findings reveal significant inequalities in PCS access across different neighborhoods under distance-based and opportunity-centric measures. However, a greater disparity exists when considering opportunities, with high-income communities having significantly better access to PCSs. Counterfactual analyses suggest that equitable deployment based on distance measures results in the least equitable outcomes when considering opportunities, primarily due to the existing disparity in opportunity distributions in our cities. Our insights highlight the complexity of locating PCSs and can guide nationwide PCS deployment for long-term societal benefits.}

      \field{abstract}{Equitable and sufficient charging infrastructure is required for transport decarbonization to reach its goals. Despite increased electric vehicle infrastructure roll out rates, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the charging market. For example, studies have evidenced disparities in electric vehicle charging placement, however, predictable as the market caters for early adopters. While there is an emerging discourse surrounding social equity in charging infrastructure, this is scattered across interdisciplinary research covering broader aspects of electric vehicle infrastructure provision with a lack of studies consolidating issues. This study aims to synthesize evidence on social equity in various aspects of electric vehicle charging infrastructure provision and set an agenda for centering social equity in the debate. Findings of this critical synthesis of research have helped to draw out the complexities involved in the equitable roll out of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, which are interlinked with an array of other dimensions including the affordability of electric vehicle purchase. Research into solutions and best practice has shown examples of local target setting, monetary incentives (grants, loans and rebates for electric vehicle purchase and charging infrastructure and smart energy tariffs) and other policy incentives (increased public overnight charging, electric car-clubs, extended battery warranties for second-hand vehicles) that can or have been employed to redress the balance. The outcomes could be utilized when developing and implementing electric vehicle strategies to support uptake across all people. Policy implications and further study suggested could ensure that communities and individuals are not locked out of the benefits of investment.}

      \field{abstract}{The availability of charging infrastructure forms the basis for the enforced market penetration of electric cars. This paper aims to examine the distribution of the allocation of future charges to the various types of charging stations in order to provide a starting point for the evaluation of the need for charging infrastructure, i.e. its number, design and cost-effectiveness. For the case study of Austria, a new approach to derive the allocation of charging processes is applied by using demographic variables and decision rules. As a result, it is found that 88% of the charges are conducted when the user is at home, which is in line with literature. Significantly, fewer charges, approx. 8.8%, are carried out at the workplace. It is a relevant finding of this work relativizing the importance of workplace charging. Only 1.7% are conducted at ‘public charging infrastructure' (e.g. public car parks, supermarkets, etc.; note that also charging at assigned and freely selectable parking lots when the owner is at home is considered home charging) and 1.5% are conducted at ‘fast charging infrastructure' (i.e. motorways). It is observed that ‘public charging infrastructure' is only used for a small proportion of the charges. In conclusion, it can be deduced that some ‘public' or fast charging stations are unable to recover their costs through charging processes but are subject to other business models.}

      \field{abstract}{Gradual electrification is widely considered as a feasible strategy for reducing the oil dependency and CO2 emissions of road transportation. In chase of these aims increasing importance has been attributed to Electric Vehicles (EVs). Although the European Commission has strongly supported sustainable mobility initiatives in recent years, with the purpose of decarbonizing road transport and mitigating urban air pollution, results are below expectations. Among the initiatives that can be implemented the most important is certainly the use of electric vehicles on a large scale but it will be necessary, in parallel, to plan an appropriate system of infrastructures that will be able to support the expansion. In this paper a methodology to provide optimal locations of electric vehicle infrastructures in a highway network is proposed. The procedure can also be used to support the implementation of the DAFI (Directive on the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure). The goal is to estimate the basic number of charging stations and determine their correct allocation on the road network by analyzing the supply and demand and considering the psychological component of the driver. In Part 1, the subject of this research article, a model is presented to detect how many charging infrastructures are required within the service areas and to identify their location. After the description of the solution algorithm, a test application is performed in order to assess model and technique. With the aim of analysing a high-level system, the model will be used, in Part 2 of the work, to calculate and distribute the charging point on the Italian case study.}

      \field{abstract}{Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) offer the potential to reduce both oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions, but have a limited utility due to factors including driver range anxiety and access to charging infrastructure. In this paper we apply NREL's Battery Lifetime Analysis and Simulation Tool for Vehicles (BLAST-V) to examine the sensitivity of BEV utility to range anxiety and different charging infrastructure scenarios, including variable time schedules, power levels, and locations (home, work, and public installations). We find that the effects of range anxiety can be significant, but are reduced with access to additional charging infrastructure. We also find that (1) increasing home charging power above that provided by a common 15 A, 120 V circuit offers little added utility, (2) workplace charging offers significant utility benefits to select high mileage commuters, and (3) broadly available public charging can bring many lower mileage drivers to near-100% utility while strongly increasing the achieved miles of high mileage drivers.}

      \field{abstract}{This study presents MoCho-TIMES, an original methodology for incorporating modal choice into energy-economy-environment-engineering (E4) system models. MoCho-TIMES addresses the scarce ability of E4 models to realistically depict behaviour in transport and allows for modal shift towards transit and non-motorized modes as a new dimension for decarbonising the transportation sector. The novel methodology determines endogenous modal shares by incorporating variables related to the level-of-service (LoS) of modes and consumers’ modal perception within the E4 modeling framework. Heterogeneity of transport users is introduced to differentiate modal perception and preferences across different consumer groups, while modal preferences are quantified via monetization of intangible costs. A support transport simulation model consistent with the geographical scope of the E4 model provides the data and mathematical expressions required to develop the approach. This study develops MoCho-TIMES in the standalone transportation sector of TIMES-DK, the integrated energy system model for Denmark. The model is tested for the Business as Usual scenario and for four alternative scenarios that imply diverse assumptions for the new attributes introduced. The results show that different assumptions for the new attributes affect modal shares and CO2 emissions. MoCho-TIMES inaugurates the possibility to perform innovative policy analyses involving new parameters to the E4 modeling framework. The results find that authority’s commitment to sustainability is crucial for a paradigmatic change in the transportation sector.}

      \field{abstract}{Decarbonizing the passenger transportation sector is critical for climate change mitigation. Existing studies on net-zero scenarios using Energy System Optimization Models (ESOM) often overlook non-monetary aspects of consumers' mobility choices but primarily focus on cost aspects. This study incorporates consumers' travel time duration and valuation, and an endogenous modal shift option into the Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM). STEM is applied in a multi-objective optimization framework to quantify the impacts of faster Public Transport (PT) and slower car speeds on modal shifts in the transport sector's transformation. Similarly, we assess scenarios where consumers weigh travel time less, reflecting improved travel productivity. The results show that speed variations on medium- and long-distance trips, which can be interpreted as policies for highway speed limits and more efficient PT, can induce modal shifts towards 5-10% higher PT demand. Its implied secondary effects across the energy system include a reduced need for electrification of heavy-duty trucks by 11% and a decrease in hydrogen demand in road transportation by 34% by 2050. If travelers weigh costs over travel time, PT becomes less competitive against cars. Thus, electric vehicles (EVs) need to play a more dominant role in decarbonization, with a demand increase of 13% in 2040 (+9.2 billion passenger kilometer (bpkm)) and 6% in 2050 (+5.0 bpkm), along with the need for additional 45,000 public chargers of 22 kW size. Policy implications include the emphasis on improved PT speeds, speed limits on highways, needs to achieve more widespread EV adoption, and the need for balancing travelers' decision factors when aiming for reduced transport CO2 emissions.}

      \field{abstract}{Various regulatory and fiscal policy instruments are in force to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases and local pollutants emitted by private cars. The incentives operate primarily-or exclusively-on the newest generation of cars. But how fast will technological developments affecting new vehicle models penetrate into the car fleet? The speed at which the adverse effects of private car use will be mitigated through the normal vehicle renewal process, or through an accelerated one, carries considerable interest. Suitable modelling tools are needed. This paper aims to demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of a bottom-up stock-flow modelling approach to private car}

      \field{abstract}{For the next 25 years, numerous transport operators have introduced sustainability commitments to mitigate carbon emissions. However, static goals to reduce fossil fuel usage and adopt renewable fuel technologies pose economic risk. This study analyzes the costs of strategic fleet replacement through a mixed integer linear program. Comparing three Norwegian transport operators, we determine cost-optimal investments in fossil and renewable fuel technologies for two approaches: One integrating and the other neglecting sustainability commitments. Our findings reveal that the truck operator’s sustainability commitments incur minimal additional costs, with battery-electric trucks proving cost-effectiveness early. In contrast, ship and airplane operators exhibit significant differences in fleet replacement decisions, resulting in additional costs ranging from +6% to +31% for ships and +4% to +11% for airplanes, across fuel cost and carbon price scenarios. Norwegian carbon price regulations fall short in incentivizing a cost-competitive technology transition for ships and airplanes. Additional policies are needed to encourage gradual fleet replacement.}

      \field{abstract}{National freight transport models are valuable tools for assessing the impact of various policies and investments on achieving decarbonization targets under different future scenarios. However, these models struggle to address several critical elements necessary for strategic planning, such as the development and adoption of new fuel technologies over time, inertia in transport fleets, and uncertainty surrounding future transport costs. In this paper, we develop a strategic network design model, named STraM, that explicitly incorporates these key factors. STraM, being a two-stage stochastic program, effectively handles long-term uncertainty by considering different future scenarios in its decision-making process.It provides a network design plan that includes infrastructure investments and fuel technology decisions, aiming to achieve cost-effective decarbonization of the freight transport system. The model output can be used as input for higher-resolution national freight transport models to yield results with greater operational detail. We demonstrate the application of STraM through a case study of Norway, offering valuable insights into the strategic planning of decarbonizing freight transport.}

      \field{abstract}{Electrification of the transport sector is crucial for achieving carbon neutrality. With increasing number of electric vehicles, attention to controlled charging as a means to provide flexibility to the electricity system with high shares of renewable generation is rising. This study explores the implications of spatially shifting electric vehicle charging load with the focus on home vs. workplace charging in Switzerland in 2035. The study applies a spatially-explicit electricity system optimization model EXPANSE with a resolution of 2′169 Swiss municipalities, combines it with a vehicle commuting matrix, and optimizes the charging of electric vehicles used for commuting purposes between the municipalities of home and workplace. The results show that workplace charging can reduce the need for electricity import and storage and promote solar photovoltaic integration unless the shares of renewable generation are already high, hence benefiting the whole system. The optimal share of workplace charging is over 90\% from the electricity system's perspective if all private vehicles in Switzerland are electric vehicles. Workplace charging is systematically preferred in northern and western Switzerland. This study highlights the potential of spatially-optimized electric vehicle charging to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of the electricity system for the broader goal of decarbonizing both the transport and electricity sectors.}

      \field{abstract}{The allocation of fast charging stations is a severe investment for the future mobility system with electric vehicles. The allocation of the first charging stations influences the profitability of all other fast charging stations and should therefore be perfectly arranged. Hence, we applied and extended the flow-refueling location model (FRLM) developed by Capar et al. (Eur J Oper Res 227(1):142-151, 2013) to the German autobahn with a focus on the states Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria with 595 nodes and 3569 highway km. Our model extension comprehends mainly the inclusion of the access distance for traffic participants to their closest network node. In order to analyze the impact of different vehicle ranges and the desired coverage of flows we defined four scenarios. The results indicate the significance of vehicle range and the desired coverage value. 20 optimally allocated fast charging stations along the highways lead already to a coverage of about 62 % (100 km vehicle range) or even 83 % (150 km vehicle range) of all trips. A complete coverage of trips requires at least 50 (150 km vehicle range), 77 (100 km vehicle range) or even 84 (70 km vehicle range) fast charging stations. The last 30 % coverage leads to a tripling of charging stations. Furthermore, a first estimation of the corresponding surcharge for fixed costs per charging process amounts to about 20 % of the total costs for a charging process.}

      \field{abstract}{To date, real cost data for Electric Vehicle (EV) rapid charging infrastructure is largely missing in the literature, preventing development of economic models to encourage private investment and limiting policy decisions. A business model has been constructed using actual capital expenditure, operating costs and usage data from the Rapid Charge Network project (RCN) which can be used to assist future investment and policy decisions. The model is run under a wide spectrum of EV uptake scenarios to provide plausible answers to a variety of research, policy and investment questions, including minimum growth rates to break even under current policy. Using real-world data we have confirmed that a financial business opportunity does exist for investment in rapid chargers on main highways and have identified the operating area in which a profit can be made. However, since UK EV adoption is still at the Innovators stage in a niche market where innovations in technology, user practices, supporting infrastructure and functionality are still required to achieve wide user acceptance, the case is also made for continued fiscal incentives to encourage investment in rapid-charging infrastructure.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper intends to establish an overall up-to-date review on Fast Charging methods for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV). This study starts from basic concepts involving single battery cell charging, current and future charging standards. Then, some popular power converter topologies employed for this application are introduced, and finally a summary of the industrial solutions available on the market are presented, as well as the ongoing projects related to the extreme fast charging (XFC) network expansion. Practical insights, considering the current BEV scenario, are employed to get a better understanding of this topic. Special attention is given to the modular design approach, analyzing its advantages and some of the factors that influence the number and size of modules that conform a fast charger solution.}

      \field{abstract}{The European Green Deal has been heralded as the“Europe's man on the moon moment” as it aims to achieve 100\% GHG reductions by 2050. Achieving the decarbonization of the energy system will be driven by a combination of factors and synergies between technological development, policy exertion and societal attitudes. In this paper, we present an original set of future storylines until the year 2050 to inspire modelers, policy makers, industry actors, and the public to understand: Without technological developments in the next decades, to what extent can we rely on societal commitment or stronger cooperation within the EU to achieve climate targets? What technological innovations could become a cornerstone of an effective European energy transition? Through analyzing four pathways (shaped by the crossroads of policy-technology-society developments), results indicate that high electrification rates are imminent to achieve a rapid decarbonization. This implies that technology development and deployment must go hand-in-hand with strong policy enforcement in the short-term to speed-up the energy transition. Then, based on a review of European energy transition scenarios, these and other insights are compared vis-à-vis with other scenarios studies to identify similarities of pathway results and to elaborate on consolidated findings relevant to the EU Green Deal.}

      \field{abstract}{One of the barriers holding back the large-scale development of electric vehicles is underdeveloped charging infrastructure. The optimal location of charging stations has received much attention, whereas the development of charging infrastructure over time and its economic implications remain a less explored topic, especially in the context of dynamic inductive charging. This work compares the infrastructure costs for two electric vehicle charging solutions deployed on highways: fast-charging stations and a dynamic charging lane based on wireless inductive charging technology. The deployment costs are estimated using a simplified infrastructure model for a highway corridor. The model first defines the required charging capacity based on projected future demand, sizes the charging infrastructure, and then determines the related costs, revenues, and net present value. A numerical example based on the French highway context is also presented. The results show that the payback period is much longer for dynamic charging lanes that for charging stations. In addition, the charging lane infrastructure cannot be installed gradually over time but requires a major investment from the start while bringing in little revenue early on.}

      \field{abstract}{Public fast charging infrastructure (FCI) is essential for the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). To reach higher EV penetration, investments into the development of a comprehensive and widespread fast charging network are necessary. However, current investments in FCI are only profitable in specific locations resulting in a severe lack of deployments in most areas. The wish for rapid development of both, EVs and related charging opportunities, requires political support measures for FCI. This paper investigates various support measures regarding their contribution to a comprehensive expansion of FCI through profitability enhancement. We illustrate the impact of different support measures on the profitability of three different charging power categories at three different located charging sides along the German freeway. Besides the traffic volume, the profitability of FCI strongly depends on the location's surrounding charging facilities and population characteristics and decreases with increasing charging power. Currently available support measures such as investment subsidies or the exemption from the electricity tax do not contribute significantly to a widespread expansion of FCI. Changes in the demand charges have a higher potential to support nationwide investments in FCI.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper presents a new perspective on assessing the financial impacts of private car usage in England and Wales using novel datasets to explore implications of motoring costs (principally Vehicle Excise Duty and road fuel costs) for households as part of the overall costs of their energy budget. Using data from an enhanced version of the Department for Transport ‘MOT’ vehicle test record database, combined with data on domestic gas and electricity consumption from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (formerly the Department of Energy and Climate Change), patterns of car usage and consequent energy consumption are investigated, and the costs of Vehicle Excise Duty and road fuel examined as a proportion of total expenditure on household direct energy consumption. Through the use of these new datasets it is possible to analyse how these vary spatially and in relation to levels of median income. The findings indicate that motoring costs are strongly regressive, with lower income areas, especially in rural locations, spending around twice as much of their income on motoring costs as the highest income areas.}

      \field{abstract}{Environmental taxes and oil market fluctuations can increase road fuel prices significantly and are likely to play a big role in the future. This raises social justice issues, as some low-income households rely on cars for access to services and opportunities but struggle to afford related expenses. The impacts of fuel price increases are unevenly spatially distributed, as shown by transport, planning and urban research. We investigate spatial patterns of vulnerability to fuel price increases in Italy, a country where the problem is particularly pronounced due to high motorisation rate relative to income, and high fuel prices. We define vulnerability as the combination of high exposure (high car use), high sensitivity (low income) and low adaptive capacity (high car dependence). Based on municipality-level data on motorisation and the journey to work from the 2011 Italian Census and official income tax revenue data for 2012 (as a proxy for income) we derive a composite indicator of vulnerability. The results show: i) a co-location of low-income and high car use on the periphery of many Italian city regions; ii) stark interregional differences, with lower income levels in the South driving high levels of vulnerability, despite lower levels of car ownership and use.}

      \field{abstract}{For passenger cars, various powertrains compete in terms of reducing environmentally-harmful emissions, smooth integration into future energy systems and economic performance. Developing a sound long-term projection of the total cost of ownership (TCO), however, remains challenging. Highlights of our present assessment, include a detailed, component-based manufacturing and operating cost analysis, as well as simulation-based component scaling and fuel consumption analysis. We apply this methodology to eight passenger car concepts based on batteries, fuel cells and combustion engines, spanning four passenger car segments and five different market development scenarios through 2050. With respect to the TCO, our analysis reveals that fully-electric powertrains utilizing batteries (BEVs) and fuel cells (FCEVs) offer the lowest-cost solutions. FCEVs exhibit small but robust benefits compared to BEVs. BEVs will undergo the earliest break-even point with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), already before 2030. Different market development scenarios would not significantly affect the long-term results.}

      \field{abstract}{Potential carbon neutrality of the global trucking, shipping and aviation sectors by 2050 could be achieved by substituting fossil fuels with renewable hydrogen and synthetic fuels. To investigate the economic impact of fuel substitution over time, a holistic cost model is developed and applied to three case studies in Norway, an early adopter of carbon-neutral freight transport. The model covers the value chains from local electricity and fuel production (hydrogen, ammonia, Fischer-Tropsch e-fuel) to fuel consumption for long-haul trucking, short-sea shipping and mid-haul aviation. The estimates are internally consistent and allow cross-mode and cross-fuel comparisons that set this work apart from previous studies more narrowly focused on a given transport mode or fuel. The model contains 150 techno-economic parameters to identify which components along the value chains drive levelized costs. This paper finds a cost reduction potential for renewable fuels of 41% to 68% until 2050, but carbon-neutral transport will suffer asymmetric cost disadvantages. Fuel substitution is most expensive in short-sea shipping, followed by mid-haul aviation and long-haul trucking. Cost developments of electricity, direct air capture of carbon, vehicle expenses, and fuel-related payload losses are significant drivers.}

      \field{abstract}{With rapidly decreasing purchase prices of electric vehicles, charging costs are becoming ever more important for the diffusion of electric vehicles as required to decarbonize transport. However, the costs of charging electric vehicles in Europe are largely unknown. Here we develop a systematic classification of charging options, gather extensive market data on equipment cost, and employ a levelized cost approach to model charging costs in 30 European countries (European Union 27, Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland) and for 13 different charging options for private passenger transport. The findings demonstrate a large variance of charging costs across countries and charging options, suggesting different policy options to reduce charging costs. A specific analysis on the impacts and relevance of publicly accessible charging station utilization is performed. The results reveal charging costs at these stations to be competitive with fuel costs at typical utilization rates exhibited already today.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper reviews the market for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure; it focuses on the types of existing charging, the main functions and actors in the market and the future policy actions required for widespread expansion. Electric vehicles represent a key technology in the mitigation of transportation greenhouse gas emissions and ambitious EV adoption targets have been set by many governments by 2030 and beyond. The rollout of EV charging infrastructure is vital in achieving this goal, as the uptake of EVs is linked to the level of coverage of EV chargers. To date, both the public and private sectors have been involved in the provision of charging stations and it is timely to consider the roles of the different actors in this market. We consider whether EV charging infrastructure is a public good or private asset and address the issues of the location of future chargers, the deployment models needed to develop, operate and own charging infrastructure, and finally the policy context for the development of charging infrastructure. We find that clear roles should be assigned to the individual public and private actors and funders, in order to achieve efficient development of the required infrastructure for large-scale EV deployment.}

      \field{abstract}{The availability of charging infrastructure forms the basis for the enforced market penetration of electric cars. This paper aims to examine the distribution of the allocation of future charges to the various types of charging stations in order to provide a starting point for the evaluation of the need for charging infrastructure, i.e. its number, design and cost-effectiveness. For the case study of Austria, a new approach to derive the allocation of charging processes is applied by using demographic variables and decision rules. As a result, it is found that 88% of the charges are conducted when the user is at home, which is in line with literature. Significantly, fewer charges, approx. 8.8%, are carried out at the workplace. It is a relevant finding of this work relativizing the importance of workplace charging. Only 1.7% are conducted at ‘public charging infrastructure’ (e.g. public car parks, supermarkets, etc.; note that also charging at assigned and freely selectable parking lots when the owner is at home is considered home charging) and 1.5% are conducted at ‘fast charging infrastructure’ (i.e. motorways). It is observed that ‘public charging infrastructure’ is only used for a small proportion of the charges. In conclusion, it can be deduced that some ‘public’ or fast charging stations are unable to recover their costs through charging processes but are subject to other business models.}
